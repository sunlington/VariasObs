This system works similarly to the [[Point Buy Weaponry]] system as it too revolves around a point total.

## Alchemical Bases
When crafting poison you will start with an alchemical base, the potency of this base determines how many, and how strong the ingredients are that you can mix with it.  This limit is measured in the Potency Cap (PC), each ingredient having an accompanying score.

| Base                     | Potency Cap (PC) | Rarity | Where to Find                     |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- | ------ | --------------------------------- |
| Diluted Verdant Solution | 2                | C      | held by any general store         |
| True Solvent             | 3                | C      | held by any alchemy store         |
| Witchsilver Base         | 4                | U      | Rarely in stock in alchemy stores |
| Planar Wash              | 5                | VR     | -                                 |
| Blackdrop                | 6                | L      | -                                 |
### Unstable Poisons
Sometimes poison brewing can go wrong, creating unstable poisons. Unstable poisons are created in the following manners:
- Exceeding the PC by 1
- Using more than 4 ingredients
- Mutagenic Mixing (explained later)

When an unstable poison is created you can attempt to stabilise it by rolling an alchemist kit check. The DC of which is equal to: $$14 + (Exceeded PC * 2) + (numIngredientsOverFour)$$
If you fail this check you must roll on the Mishap Table below:

| D12 | Mishap                                                                                                       |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | Catastrophic Failure: Poison and ingredients are destroyed                                                   |
| 2   | No Effect: Ingredients are kept, but the poison has no effect                                                |
| 3   | Weaked Mix: Poison loses 1 random effect                                                                     |
| 4   | Diminished Potency: Dc reduced by 5                                                                          |
| 5   | Delayed Activation: Poison takes 1d4 rounds to activate                                                      |
| 6   | Random Target: First creature you attack after crafting is affected                                          |
| 7   | Self-Dosing: Crafter must save vs. their own poison.                                                         |
| 8   | Volatility: Poison deals 1d6 extra damage, but deals this additional damage to the user aswell               |
| 9   | Short Shelf Life: Poison expires in 10 minutes                                                               |
| 10  | Overload: Damage effects are doubled, but save is made with advantage                                        |
| 11  | Corrosive Leak: Crafter's blowgun or weapon takes -1 on attack rolls for 24h                                 |
| 12  | Chaotic Reaction: Roll 1 random effect from any ingredient in your inventory and add it, then reroll mishap. |

### Mutagenic Mixing
You can add the effect of one poison to another, this uses the PC cap of the highest base among the poisons and combines the PC counts. Mixing poisons in this way always results in an unstable poison.
