#homebrew
The below list contains some entries that we have always used and are somewhat unnecessary but for the sake of  completeness I will mention them anyway, also for newer players the rules are clear.
You are allowed to use any [[Varias]] specific homebrew, furthermore we shall be using the following homebrew rules:
##### Changed Rules
- **Better XP**
	- Instead of the normal D&D xp rules, or milestone rules. We will use an altered version of the Pf2e system. It is similar to how we did it before, an xp bar from 0-1000 and upon reaching 1000xp you level up. However, the party will share an xp bar. If someone were to defeat an encounter by themselves they contribute to this xp all the same. General xp gainage will also be lowered slightly to compensate for this fact. 
- **Stronger Crits**
	- When a creature rolls a critical strike, it deals maximum weapon damage, and thus does not need to roll for damage. This also includes any attachers such as sneak attack, smites, or hunter's mark. It however, does not maximise additional effects such as poison damage, or other types that are locked behind an additional savingthrow.
- **Higher Health**
	- When you level up, if you roll a 1 on your hit die you may reroll it once. Taking the new result as your health increase.
- **Lucky Coin** 
	- A system to replace inspiration, you each have a coin in front of you that you can choose to flip to reroll your previous dice roll, it also gets flipped if you roll a nat 1. Once flipped however, I (the dm) can flip it back to impose disadvantage on any roll. Therefore you will have a constant up and down, and inspiration can be used way more. The coin also gets flipped back if I (the dm) hit your character with a critical hit.
-  **Alternate Flanking**
	- If a creature is surrounded by two creatures on opposite sides those creatures get a +2 bonus to their attack roll, unless the target has a passive perception of 18 or higher, or can feasibly see in multiple direction. If 3 or more creatures surround another they get a +5 bonus with the same restrictions.
- **The 'Baldurs Gate 3' section**
	- Spiritual weapon now actually acts as a summon and has its own turn directly after the caster's turn. Freeing up your bonus action, however the spiritual weapon now has 20 (base) health and upcasting it adds 5 per level.
	- Health potion cost a bonus action to drink and can be thrown, as an action, to heal creatures in a 10 ft square, administiring a health potion to another creature also costs an action.
- **Better Wounds**
	- Each time you go unconcious beyond the first time per longrest you gain a wound. When you gain a third wound you die. A critical success on a death save, the restoration spell or a succesful DC15 medicne check with a medicine kit removes one wound. This wound is represented by a failed death save when you go down additional times.
- **No more 'Infinite' Ammo**
- **Quick Attunement**
	- Attuning to an item costs an action, unattuning takes 10 minutes.
- **Hexagons Bestagons**
- **Dangerous Fright**
	- The *frightened* condition will be completely changed, the official rulings make for boring combat, and only make the combat even more static than 5e combat already is. Therefor the frightened condition now has the following rules:
		- **Building Fright**: You can now be frightened by multiple sources, stacking up to 3 times. Making saves against these frightened effect will only remove 1 stack at a time.  (This part is still very experimental, it might not come into play alot, if thats the case I'll change it.)
		- **D20 Checks Affected**: you gain a -2 penalty to all D20 Checks for each level of fear.
		- **Weakened Defenses**: For each level of fear you are easier to critical hit, increasing the range for these critical hits. At 1 level of fear creatures attacking the feared creature crit at a 19, at 2 levels at 18 and at level 3 at 17.
##### Additional Rules
- **Stress**
	- In certain stressful moments(DMs discretion) you might have to roll a challenging Resolve check (wisdom save), gaining a *Virtue* on a success or a *Vice* on a fail. These have a variety of effects detailed in a document that will follow this premise. Stress aswell as the virtues and vices can be removed by spending an entire day resting, or doing light activities such as shopping.
- - **Bloodied and Mortal**
	- If a creature is below 50% health they are 'bloodied' when below 10% they are 'mortal'. This is so you can approximate an opponent's health. Some homebrew magic items or abilities might rely on these thresholds aswell.
- **Final Stand**
	- When you are reduced to 0 hitpoints, you can choose to keep going, and as a reaction, heal yourself for an amount equal to a single roll of your hit die plus your constitution modifier. Additionally you gain an exhaustion level and must succeed a constitution savingthrow equal to the damage taken. If you fail this savingthrow you must roll on the Lingering Injuries table which matches the damage type: https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LWu_LDHSZko9udS4vwN
- **Called Shots**
	- When a creature is bloodied, and you have advantage on the attack roll against that creature, you can choose to forgo that advantage and make a normal attack roll instead, targetting a specific part of the creature that you can see. Your attack deals normal damage, and the creature must make a constitution savingthrow equal to the damage dealt. On a fail they must roll on the lingering injuries table matching the damage type. They however can only gain the top 3 injuries of each table, unless the attack was a critical hit.
- **Intelligence Matters**
	- For each positive bonus you have in your intelligence stat you gain an additional proficiency bonus in any skill, if you have a negative bonus you lose that many proficiencies. 
- **Sprint**
	- You can sacrifice your entire turn, except for your reaction, to run 5 times your movement speed in a straight line, opportunity attacks provoked while sprinting have advantage.
- **Better Disengage**
	- When you hit, and deal damage to a creature, you may spent a bonus action to take the disengage action.
