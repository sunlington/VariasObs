## Universal Abilities
#### Mechanical - Cost 2
This weapon is the product of a complicated design, and takes some knowledge to utilise properly. When making attack or damage rolls with this weapon you can use your intelligence modifier instead of the normal modifier.
#### Heavy - Cost -1
Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon’s size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.

This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.
## Melee Abilities

#### Cleave - Cost 3
If you hit a creature with a melee attack roll using this weapon, you can make a melee attack roll with the weapon against a second creature within 5 feet of the first that is also within your reach. On a hit, the second creature takes the weapon's damage, but don't add your ability modifier to that damage unless that modifier is negative. You can make this extra attack only once per turn
#### Graze - Cost 2
If your attack roll with this weapon misses a creature, you can deal damage to that creature equal to the ability modifier you used to make the attack roll. This damage is the same type dealt by the weapon, and the damage can be increased only by increasing the ability modifier.

#### Topple - Cost 2
If you hit a creature with this weapon, you can force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 plus the ability modifier used to make the attack roll and your [Proficiency Bonus](https://5e.tools/variantrules.html#proficiency_xphb)). On a failed save, the creature has the [Prone](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#prone_xphb) condition.

#### Nick - Cost 1
When you make the extra attack of the Light property, you can make it as part of the [Attack](https://5e.tools/actions.html#attack_xphb) action instead of as a [Bonus Action](https://5e.tools/variantrules.html#bonus%20action_xphb). You can make this extra attack only once per turn

If the creature is hit more than once by weapons that have this property, the [Speed](https://5e.tools/variantrules.html#speed_xphb) reduction doesn't exceed 10 feet.
#### Finesse - Cost 1
When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.
#### Light - Cost 1
A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons. Weapons with the light property cannot have the *Two Handed* or *Heavy* properties
#### Reach - Cost 1
This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.
### Versatile - Cost 0

#### Thrown - Cost 0
If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack, and you can draw that weapon as part of the attack. If the weapon is a Melee weapon, use the same ability modifier for the attack and damage rolls that you use for a melee attack with that weapon.
Weapons with the *Heavy* property cannot also have *Thrown*

## Ranged Abilities
Each ranged weapon per default has the *Ammunition* property
#### Ammunition - Basekit
You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a [quiver](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Items:Quiver?expansion=34047#content), [case](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Items:Crossbow%20bolt%20case?expansion=34047#content), or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield. If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see “[Improvised Weapons](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Weapons?expansion=34047#toc_14)” later in the section). A [sling](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Items:Sling?expansion=34047#content) must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.
#### Rapid Fire X - Cost 2 - 4 
*X=1 Cost 2, X=2 Cost 3, X=3 Cost 4*
Some advanced firearms developed in [[Varias]] possess the **Rapid Fire** property, denoted by a tier (I, II, or III).

When a creature makes an attack with a weapon that has the Rapid Fire property, it rolls a number of d4s equal to the weapon’s Rapid Fire tier. The total rolled determines the number of individual attacks made as part of that action. Each of these attacks is resolved separately, using the attacker’s normal attack bonus and damage rolls. All attacks must target the same creature unless the weapon's description states otherwise.

If a weapon has a magazine the **Rapid Fire** attack amount cannot exceed the current magazine size.

After making a **Rapid Fire** attack, the attacker must make a Constitution saving throw. The DC is 10 + the number of attacks made. On a fail you gain **Recoil** until the end of the user's next turn.
#### Torrent X ft. - Cost 2 - 4
*15ft - Cost 2, 20ft - Cost 3, 25ft - Cost 4*
A weapon with the **Torrent** property unleashes a wide spray or burst of destructive energy. When you make an attack with a Torrent weapon, instead of targeting a single creature, you may choose to activate its Torrent effect.

If you do, all creatures in a **X-foot cone** must make a Dexterity saving throw. The DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity or Intelligence modifier (determined by the weapon’s design). On a failed save, a creature takes the weapon’s normal damage. On a success, it takes half damage.

- Using the Torrent effect consumes **twice the normal ammunition** or charges.
- Torrent attacks do **not require an attack roll** and **cannot critically hit**.
- Torrent can only be used once per turn unless the weapon states otherwise.
#### Ray - Cost 3
Instead of firing physical ammunition, this weapon emits a concentrated ray of energy, light, or elemental force. When making an attack with a Ray weapon, the user targets all creatures in a **line** extending from the weapon.
- As an action, the user fires a ray in a **5-foot-wide line** that is **20 feet long**, unless otherwise specified.
- All creatures in the line must make a **Dexterity saving throw**. The DC is equal to **8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence or Dexterity modifier**, depending on the weapon’s design.
- On a failed save, a creature takes the weapon’s full damage. On a successful save, it takes half damage.
- Cover applies normally to creatures in the line, potentially shielding them from the ray.
#### Charge  - Cost 2
Weapons with the **Charge** property store and release immense energy, building heat with each use. Each time you fire the weapon, you gain 1 level of Charge, unless the weapon description states otherwise.
- At the start of your turn, the weapon’s Charge level decreases by 1 automatically.
- If you fire the weapon while its current Charge level is 2 or higher, you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or suffer overheat consequences. The DC is equal to 10 + the current Charge level.
- If you reach the weapon’s maximum Charge level of 4 and attempt to fire again, the weapon explodes, dealing 2d6 fire damage per remaining ammo to the user and damaging the weapon beyond repair.

Overheat Consequences on a failed save:
- Charge 2: Take 1d6 fire damage.
- Charge 3: Take 2d6 fire damage and the weapon becomes **Jammed** 
- Charge 4: Roll a d20. On a 10 or lower, the weapon explodes as above. On a success, take 3d6 fire damage and the weapon becomes Jammed.
You can choose to not fire the weapon to allow the Charge to dissipate normally.
#### Magazine X - Cost -1 - 3
*X = 2 Cost -1, X = 5 Cost 0, X = 8 Cost 1, X = 11 Cost 2, X = 14 Cost 3*
This weapon uses charges, or a magazine filled with ammunition to power its shots. When making an attack roll you expend 1 (or more if specified) ammunition, Once you reach 0 ammo you must spend an attack action to reload the weapon. You have a maximum amount of ammunition equal to **X**
#### Loading - Cost -2
Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make. Instead of taking the attack action you can choose to reload this weapon.
#### Bolt-Action - Cost -2
This weapon has a bolt-action lever that must be pulled between each shot.
After each attack the user must use a bonus action to cycle the bolt in order to attack again. 
#### Volatile X Cost -1 to -3 
This weapon must be used with caution due to its volatile nature. When rolling the attack roll if the dice roll lands on the value X or lower the weapon gains **Jammed**. The **X** value cannot exceed 3.
