The Voldakken are wizards who practice a ruthless and precise form of spellcraft, believing that magic is at its deadliest when delivered at close range. By focusing their arcane power into concentrated spellstrikes, Voldakken wizards blend the lethal precision of an assassin with the versatility of a mage.

## Voldakken Focus
_3rd-level Voldakken feature_

Through intense mental discipline, you learn to maintain focus even amid chaos.

You gain a number of **Focus Points** equal to your proficiency bonus. You can expend these points to fuel various Voldakken features. You regain all expended Focus Points when you finish a long rest.

Additionally, you gain proficiency with light armor.

## Spell Blade
_3rd-level Voldakken feature_

You learn to compress your magic into a precise and devastating strike.

When you make a spell attack roll against a single creature, you can expend 1 Focus Point to enhance the spell in the following ways:

- The spell’s range becomes **touch** if it has a greater range.
- The spell deals an extra **2d6** damage of the same type as the spell.

You can use this feature **once per turn**.

The extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class: to **3d6** at 6th level, **4d6** at 10th level, and **5d6** at 14th level.

## Cunning Spells
_6th-level Voldakken feature_

You have learned to subtly reshape your spellstrikes, trading raw power for tactical advantages.

When you use your Spell Blade feature, you can forgo a number of the Spell Blade damage dice to apply one or more of the following effects. You must choose these effects before making the spell attack roll.

**Transmuted Blade (1d6)**
You change the damage type of the spell to one of the following types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder.

**Reaching Blade (1d6)**
The spell’s range becomes **10 feet** instead of touch.

**Fading Blade (2d6)**
If the spell attack hits, you become **invisible** until the start of your next turn. This invisibility ends early if you attack, cast a spell, or force a creature to make a saving throw.

**Twin Blade (3d6)**
You can target a second creature within the spell’s range. Make a separate spell attack roll against the second target, which is made with disadvantage. On a hit, the second target takes the extra damage from your Spell Blade feature.

## Voldakken Concentration
_10th-level Voldakken feature_

Your disciplined mind refuses to release its grip on active magic.

When you fail a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell, you can expend 1 Focus Point to succeed on the saving throw instead.

## Voldakken Execution
_14th-level Voldakken feature_

You know how to finish a wounded foe with ruthless efficiency.

When you hit a creature with a Spell Blade–enhanced spell and that creature has **half its hit points or fewer**, you can expend 2 Focus Points to deal **maximum damage** with your Spell Blade damage dice instead of rolling them.
