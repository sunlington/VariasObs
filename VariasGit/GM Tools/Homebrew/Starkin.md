**Superior Darkvision**
You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors only as shades of gray in darkness.

**Echoes of the Stars**
You are partially touched by the lingering essence of the Volotheans. Choose one of the following emotional resonances, which affects your magical affinity:
- **Fearbound**: You learn the _Cause Fear_ spell.
- **Sorrowborn**: You learn the _Dissonant Whispers_ spell.
- **Wrathfed**: You learn the _Hellish Rebuke_ spell.

You can cast the chosen spell once per long rest using this trait. Wisdom, Charisma, or Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it (choose when you select this species).

At 5th level, you may cast your chosen spell _twice_ per long rest.

**Dreamwalking**
You have a partial connection to the dreaming world of the Volotheans. You can cast _Detect Thoughts_ once per long rest without expending a spell slot. When you do, the spell's duration becomes Concentration, up to 1 minute.

Additionally, during a Long Rest, you may attempt a **Dreamwalk**: you receive cryptic, symbolic visions. Once per long rest, you can roll a d6 and ask the DM a yes/no/maybe question about future events. On a 5 or 6, you receive a meaningful (but symbolic) answer.
