##### **Roleplay / Skill-Based Encounters – Life-Draining Gluttony Theme**

1. **The Withering Village**
    - **Description:** The party comes across a village where crops have turned to ash and animals are emaciated or missing. A few desperate survivors cling to life.
    - **Challenge:** Persuasion/Insight/Arcana checks (DC 16) reveal that a nearby gluttony demon has been feeding on the land itself.
    - **Twist:** Survivors may be too fearful to help, or might attempt to “sacrifice” the party’s supplies to appease the demon.
2. **Fading River**
    - **Description:** A river used to sustain life; now it runs black and viscous, and fish float lifeless on its surface.
    - **Challenge:** Nature/Arcana check DC 15 reveals the water is being drained magically. Creative solutions (diversion, ritual, purifying spells) can restore a portion of it temporarily.
    - **Twist:** Using magic to “fight back” the corruption may attract a wandering gluttony scout (CR 6-7).
3. **The Hollow Forest**
    - **Description:** Trees are skeletal, leaves long gone, air feels heavy. Occasional whispering echoes promise power if the party surrenders their life force.
    - **Challenge:** Survival/Perception DC 16 to safely navigate; Arcana/Insight DC 16 to detect psychic traps or illusions.
    - **Roleplay Options:** A trapped spirit may beg for help, requiring the party to choose between saving it or preserving their own resources.
4. **The Bargaining Hunger**
    - **Description:** A semi-sentient gluttony demon approaches, speaking in a voice like cracking earth. It offers safe passage in exchange for something living: plants, livestock, even a minor magical creature.
    - **Twist:** If the party refuses, it follows them at a distance, slowly consuming the world around them, creating environmental hazards on the next encounter.

### **Landmark / Environmental Encounters – Life-Draining Theme**

1. **Dust Plains**
    - Once fertile farmland, now turned to barren gray dust. Even footprints vanish quickly.
    - **Hazard:** Exhaustion if the party rests here; rations spoil rapidly.
    - **Twist:** Occasionally, a “ghost of growth” (CR 4-5) flickers into existence, begging for water or life before fading away.
2. **The Hollow Spire**
    - A ruined tower whose stones are drained of all color, and the air is lifeless.
    - **Challenge:** Investigation or Arcana (DC 16) reveals latent magic that could be restored, but doing so risks attracting the attention of a powerful gluttony demon.
3. **The Bleached Lake**
    - A body of water that once teemed with fish now mirrors the sky in a sickly white sheen. Touching it feels like energy being pulled from your body.
    - **Hazard:** Any character spending more than 1 minute in direct contact must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution save or take 2d6 necrotic damage and gain one level of exhaustion.
4. **Crumbled Market / Town Ruins**
    - What used to be a bustling hub of commerce is now piles of gray dust. Occasionally, a ghostly merchant or item flickers into existence, replaying the world as it once was.
    - **Roleplay Opportunity:** Investigating the ruins can yield lore, magical remnants, or a clue to the location of the demon feeding on the region.
