**DISCLAIMER:** I'm writing this in english because I am not translating all of the dnd rules into Dutch, as that will cost way too much effort and i'm lazy.
# Character Creation
Let's start with the most fun part, creating your character. First lets see what Class you want to play, each class is rated on difficulty. This rating is from 1-5, 1 being easy, 5 being difficult. The archetypes are also rated on this same scale. However these are proportional to the classes rating, this means that a class of difficulty 1 with an archetype of difficulty 5 still means the archetype is quite easy to play, just the hardest that class has.
## Classes
### Martial Classes
These are classes that use weaponry to deal most of their damage, this can vary from swords, spears and bows, to primitive firearms such as flintlock pistols.

##### Fighter, 1/5
Is good in its namesake: fighting. Fighters specialise in using their weaponry to the best of their capabilities and using clever fighting styles/tactics to out maneouver their opponents. They can do this at range with a bow and arrow or up-close and personal with a trusty sword. Fighters are often a bit tankier than other classes due to their affinity with higher levels of armour and gaining more health. 

**Pros:**
- Tanky
- Versatile 

**Cons:**
- Less roleplay-focused abilities
- Not exceedingly good at anything (jack of all trades master of none)

###### Archetypes
**Champion**, Difficulty 1/5
With this archetype the fighter gets better at fighting... A bit anticlimactic but this is a very simple archetype. You gain a higher chance to critically hit your opponents and gain a bit more movement when you do so. While simple increasing your chance to critically strike is a very powerful ability in D&D, if you're lucky atleast.

**Arcane Archer**, Difficulty 3/5
This is a ranged focus archetype for fighter. Giving you the ability to shoot magical arrows. These magical arrows vary greatly in effect; from sending the attacked creature to a different dimension for a short time to having homing arrows. This archetype  makes the fighter even more versatile than it already is with answers to many combat-related situations. However knowing when to use what arrow might be a little tricky. 

**Rune Knight**, Difficulty 4/5
This archetype allows the fighter to harness the power of the giants, carving runes on your armour and weapons to strengthen your armaments. You can choose 2 , of 3 runes to carve into your armour, each with a different effect, below is a short description of each rune:
- Cloud Rune
	- Once you, or one of your allies get hit with an attack, you can choose to redirect the attack using the cloud giants' magic to any creature within 30ft. of your character.
- Fire Rune
	- When attacking a creature you can invoke the rune to summon fiery shackles  to chain the enemy, burning them. They can try to fight back against the chains to break them, if they fail to do so they are restrained taking even more damage.
- Stone Rune
	- When a creatures ends their turn near you, you can attempt to stun(Charm) them for a while.

Next to these runes you also gain the ability to invoke the giants' might, making you larger, stronger, and deal more damage.
##### Rogue, 3/5
Rogues are the class focussed on stealth, sabotage and sneak attacks. They are one of the few classes to gain expertise in skills making them excell at skills of their choosing (although this is often stealth). They focus on dealing high amounts of damage in single attacks, but are quite squishy in return.

Pros:
- Highly Specialised in skills of choosing
- High single target damage

Cons:
- Not great at dealing with multiple targets
- Not a lot of defences in the early levels.
###### Archetypes
**Scion of the Three**, Difficulty 3/5
You allign yourself with one of the Dead Three: Bane, deity of Tyranny; Bhaal , deity of Violence and murder; and Myrkul deity of death. Yes this is the edgelord subclass. This archetype allows you to teleport towards enemies that are low on health to finish them off. And you gain a simple spell, and damage resistance depending on which deity you chose.

**Assassin**, Difficulty 2/5
This archetype is good at assassinating people... Some of these names are really on the nose. You can act faster in combat, and can get free critical strikes if you suprise attack your foes. This archetype excells in the first round of combat, attempting to instantly assassinate high value targets. Additionally you  can use disguise and poison kits to help with your assassinating endevours.

**Arcane Trickster**, Difficulty 3/5
This archetype turns the rogue into a halfcaster, allowing them to cast some low-level (mostly illusion focused) spells. In addition you gain a 'mage hand legerdemain' which is essentially telekinesis but only for smaller objects. 
##### Barbarian, 1/5
The rage driven berserker. The barbarian is exactly what it sounds like, pure rage with a big blade dealing large amounts of damage and having an even larger health pool. The barbarian's main gameplay surrounds its Rage ability granting you extra damage, and more effective health, but forcing you to constantly stay in the fight.

Pros:
- Very hard to kill
- Large damage considering their survivability.

Cons:
- No roleplay focused abilities
- Combat often results in you standing still on the frontlines while tanking all the damage.

###### Archetypes
**Berserker**, Difficulty 1/5 
This archetype makes your rage even more impactful, adding explosive amounts of damage to your attacks, but allowing for your opponents to more easily hit you in return. 

**Wild Heart**, Difficulty 1/5 - 3/5 depending on your chosen animal
This archetype gets in touch with primal nature, allowing you to harness the power of beasts to strengthen your rage. Specifically 3 animals:
- The Bear
	- Makes you even more tanky during your rage, giving resistances to almost all damage
- The Eagle
	- Makes you more manevourable during your rages, allowing for quick repositioning or attacking even more enemies.
- The Wolf
	- Makes your rage a teamwide buff, allowing your allies to hit enemies close to you much easier.
Next to these improvements you can also talk to some animals.

**Wildmagic**, Difficulty 5/5 
This is a bit of a weird archetype, you are able to detect magic items and magical effects. But far more importantly, it alters your rage in a curious way. Each time you enter rage a random magical effect happens, this ranges from summoning a small spirit that suicide bombs into enemies, to bursting into an explosion of tentacles dealing damage to every enemy around you.

##### Monk 4/5
Monk is super fast, and attacks even faster. They channel their ki to dash across the battlefield overwhelming the enemy with an unending barrage of attacks. In terms of weapons you are somewhat restricted to monk-weapons. Think about Bo-staffs, small swords or nun-chucks. Their Ki is also their resource fueling most of their abilities. Without it the monk is quite vulnerable.

Pros:
- By far the fastest class
- You will be attacking a lot

Cons:
- Without their resources drastically loses power
- restricted in weaponry
###### Archetypes
**Sun Soul** 1/5
This archetype allows you to channel your inner Goku, and throw fiery laserbeams across the battlefield. However using these laser beams does drain your ki.

**Open Hand** 3/5
This archetypes strengthens your unending barrage of attacks by adding additional effects. While beating the crap out of your enemies you can now throw them on the floor, push them 15ft away from you or daze them slowing their reaction speed. This archetype makes the monk extremely versatile, due to your high speeds you can quickly control the entire battlefield allowing for quick takedowns.

**Drunken master** 3/5
This archetypes allows you to quickly dip in and out of combat, more so than the monk can already do. It makes you faster and allow you to dodge enemies' attacks. Additionally it grants you some roleplay related abilities, particularly being good at performing and, of course drinking. 
### Half Casters
These are a special type of class, while they do gain spellcasting, it is always limited in a way, for example paladin and ranger gain only low level spells, while the warlock can only cast a few per day. Naturally they gain other abilities to make up for this lack of power.
##### Paladin 3/5
Paladin channels the power through their oath. They are similar to fighters with their tankiness and weapon usage, but they also gain some divine spells. These spells are mostly self-enhancements, strengthening your armour, forcing enemies to only attack you or imbueing your blade with the wrath of god to smite down your enemies. Without their magic they are weaker fighters, but while they still have their divine powers they are hard to kill, and deal tremendous amounts of damage.
Because of their magic coming from their oath, breaking said oath gets rid of your magic, and can have even worse consequences.

Pros:
- Can deal explosive damage
- Very tanky

Cons:
- Resource dependant
- Can lose all of their power if they dont keep their oath

###### Archetypes
For paladin each archetype gives them a variety of archetype-related spells, these will be ommited for the sake of simplicity

**Devotion**
This archetype binds itself to justice and order, vowing to always keep their word, protect the weak and act with honor. You can use this divine justice to imbue your weapon with holy light, causing it to glow and deal more damage for a while. This does not stop you from imbueing your blade with other effects in the paladins arsenal allowing for powerful combinations.

**Vengeance**
Vengeance paladins swore to avenge those they lost, or those we were wronged, they vow to show no mercy to the wicked and aid those harmed by injustice. You can channel this vengeance to utter words of enmity to your foes weakening their defences allowing for quick takedowns, even in large scale battles. 

**Crown**
Paladins of this archetype sworde to protect a single sovereign, or an entire nation, eitherway they are the classic "White Knight". Courage is the focal point of this archetypes, allowing the paladin to challenge creatures, forcing them to fight them, or turn the tide in combat by granting all injured creatures of their choice to regain some health. These paladins embody never giving up in the face of adversity and pushing through no matter the cost.

##### Ranger  2/5
(Disclaimer, I dont like this class. I love it's concept but its executed horribly <3)
Rangers are similar to paladins, depending on their spells to bolster their power. But instead of paladin's defensive focus ranger focusses on dealing more damage with their attacks and adding special effects. Additionally they can focus their energy on a single target, this exposes their weakspots allowing you to deal more damage. It is important to state that the name "ranger" does not mean you have to use ranged weaponry, melee works perfectly fine aswell.

Pros:
- Fighter but with magic!
- The effects granted by their spells can have really cool interactions

Cons:
- Often the damage bonusses are quite lackluster
- Is severely limited due to certain spell casting rules.
- Doesn't really do anything other classes dont do better (I can expand on this if you want a 15 min rant)

###### Archetypes
(Another disclaimer, while I dont like the class the archetypes are some of the coolest in the game)
For ranger each archetype gives them a variety of archetype-related spells, these will be ommited for the sake of simplicity

**Horizon Walker** 2/5
Horizon walkers gain the ability to harness the power of alternate dimensions. Not only can you detect nearby portals, you can also use them to empower your arrows to deal even more damage. It also gives you access to teleportation spells and other such extradimensional magics.

**Drakewarden** 4/5
This archetype is quite simple to explain. You get a pet baby drake that the ranger can control. Each time it is summoned it can change its element to best suit the current needs. While it cannot fly, nor breathe fire, it can infuse these elements into its strikes and bites to deal increased amounts of damage. Additionally it is an extra ally on the battlefield, which is a very big deal in turn based games such as D&D

**Gloomstalker** 3/5
This archetype is all about stalking your prey to find the best opportunity for an ambush. This makes you faster during these ambushes, and deal more damage as you take advantage of the suprise. Unlike the assassin rogue you can take advantage of these bonusses for a bit longer than just the first turn of combat.
To aid in your hunting you gain the ability to see clearly in the dark, on top of that you can turn invisible to creatures relying on darkvision to see you when you are obscured in the dark.

##### Warlock 4/5
'Warlocks are so cool'
Warlocks are spell casters, but quite different then the rest. They gain their power by making a deal with a powerful entity, whether that be a devil, a god or an unknowable entity dormand in the sea. They use these powers to host rituals and cast spells. Their spellcasting however is quite limited, only 2 spells per rest, however their power lies in lesser magical effects and the aforementioned rituals. Their main mechanic is something known as "Eldritch Invocations" these are boosts that the warlock can pick to alter their playstyle. This turns warlock into one of the most customizable classes, really allowing you to create your own build that accomodates your playstyle the best. These eldritch invocations are almost more impactful than the archetypes.

Pros:
- Awesome backstory/ story implications
- The most customizable class in the game
- Can create very powerful combinations

Cons:
- Requires a bit more insight to find these powerful combinations
- Very limited spellcasting 

###### Archetypes
**Fiend** 2/5
The classic "Deal with the Devil" shtick. Granting the warlock access to fiery spells. But more importantly, this archetype can harvest the souls of those slain by the warlock's hands to revitalize the warlock and replenish some hit points. This keeps the warlock in the fight, and makes this archetype excel in large scale combat.

**Hexblade** 2/5
This is the 'melee' warlock archetype, this time around you did not make your deal with a fancy living entity but with a cursed blade. While this class does give you a badass magical weapon and armour training right from the get go that is not all it does. The hexblade gains the ability to extend the curse on their blade to their foes, granting a bonus to damage, a higher critical hit chance and life regeneration on kill. 
This sounds superbly powerful right? Naturally it has its downside, you can only curse one creature per day, so use it when it counts!

**Undead** 2/5
You want to be emo? Well here you go! this archetype made a deal with a random corpse they found in a ditch. Now they can harness the power of the dead body odor to take on a nightmarish guise. While in this 'Form of Dread' the warlock gains a little bit more health, but far more importantly has the ability to make people frightened of them each time they attack a creature. Frightening creatures is quite a powerful status effect having both offensive and defensive benefits for the entire party. 
### Spellcasters
Disclaimer, anything about the full spellcasters is written by Noah, because he is the spellcasting
fuckboy. So with any questions about spells, go to him. Noah is more smartpants when it comes to
spellcasting. Any questions about the actual character creation should still go to Roel.
##### Cleric 2/5
You align yourself with a god. You are a believer in the higher power, which grants
you magical powers in return. Clerics are usually beefy frontline casters, focusing
mostly on healing and survivability for both you and your allies, but they can do
explosive damage as well, so don’t be fooled. If you want to get into spellcasting,
cleric is probably the easiest way into it. With your channel divinity and spells,
nothing or no one can stop you from achieving your goals.
What is channel divinity?
Channel divinity is an ability only available to the cleric (and paladin but shh). It's what makes cleric, well,
cleric. You touch your holy symbol you always carry around, and a magical effect
happens. Depending on your archetype, channel divinity does something else.

Pros:
- Great support
- Great damage
- Great survivability
- Just a really good Class
Cons:
- Limited resources
- too little cons to name because it’s so good

###### Archetypes
**life 1/5**
From all the available archetypes for cleric, this is the easiest one. The life domain
cleric focuses mostly just on healing. With your additional ability, all your healing
spells heal a little more. And with your channel divinity you heal all your allies around
you. 

**tempest 4/5**
This is the damage archetype for clerics. This archetype is all about timing and
precision, with possible huge outcomes. Tempest clerics focus mostly on doing
thunder and lightning damage. They can counter attack enemies if they stand in their
range when the cleric gets attacked, and they can maximize their thunder and
lighting damage thanks to their channel divinity. It is a little difficult to get the hang
of, thanks to the timing and limited resources. But if you play it well, you can get
some “shocking” results (get it, shocking because lighting? right get it? anyways…)

**Order 3/5**
This archetype is all about controlling the battlefield, ally or foe. Order archetype
clerics are very focused on the law, and making sure everyone follows it. This
archetype is great at getting people to listen to you and making them follow your will.
Something the archetype can also do, is making your allies attack during your turn. If
a supportive spell has been used on an ally, that ally can use their reaction to attack
during your turn. And with your channel divinity, you can make all enemies around
you charmed, and let them drop the items they are holding. This archetype is great
at supporting your allies not just with heals, but with other stuff too.

##### Bard 3/5
Are you into music, poetry, entertainment, or anything in that sense, you’ll really like bard.
Bard is a very charismatic class, focused on supportive skills, or big pp damage.
They are a jack of all trades. You like to inspire your allies, inside and outside of
combat. You are the hope many people search for. With your bardic inspiration and
your wide variety of spells, everyone will have heard of your name.
What is bardic inspiration?
Bardic inspiration is a resource limited to the bard. As a bonus action, you can
"inspire" your allies, granting them bonuses to their rolls. This is an extremely
powerful tool. But when you choose an archetype, it can do a whole lot of other stuff.
It’s great, I swear!

Pros:
- Very versatile
- Great support
Cons:
- Jack of all trades, master of none
- Can feel a little lackluster because of emphasis on support

###### Archetypes
**glamour 2/5**
Glamour, majesty and beauty. This is what a glamour bard is all about (you are
gaaaaay). The glamour bard is great at illusion and enchantment magic. If the
glamour bard casts any spell from that class, they can try to charm or frighten an
enemy. And they can use one of their bardic inspirations to buff a number of their
allies equal to how charismatic they are (more on that later). This buff grants the ally
more hp and it can make them faster. Thank you gays for this!

**valor 1/5**
Valor bard is if a fighter suddenly really likes the trumpet. The valor bard is more
classified as a melee caster, because they also like to use weapon attacks. But that's
not all! With the bardic inspiration they can also add the die to defensive and
offensive moves. That's it…. It seems like not a lot, but this opens up a lot of
opportunities.

**creation 2/5**
The creation bard is very versatile in their supportive capabilities. The Creation bard
is all about creating stuff from nothingness. If the bardic inspiration is used on an ally,
a little musical note comes along with it. This musical note has its own uses,
depending on what roll it uses. That's what makes it very versatile. And for some
extra bonus, they can create a musical instrument from nothingness, and I think
that's pretty neat.

##### Wizard 3/5
“Shadow wizard money gang, we looooove casting spells.” The wizard is someone
who learned their way into magic, via the magic of attending your college hearings.
The wizard only knows their way around magic. They are a magic powerhouse, with
huge potential. You start off with a lot of spells, but if you find a spellscroll
along your travels, you can learn it permanently! But in return, they are the class with
the fewest defensive options. If you want to live the fantasy of being an old guy from
a big fuckass tower, this class is perfect for you!
Pros:
- Has a way to get their resources back in a fight
- Is great at ranged combat
- Has great area of effect damage
Cons:
- You are EXTREMELY squishy
- Only has their spells and nothing else

###### Archetypes
**Abjurer 1/5**
This is THE defensive option for wizards. Whenever the abjurer wizard cast a spell
from the abjuration school, they can take a strand of the magic cast, and weave it
around them for a hp soaking shield. It makes the wizard a little less fragile.

**Evoker 1/5**
The evoker wizard is great at consistent damage. If a cantrip (a weak spell that
doesn't cost any spellslots) misses, or the enemy succeeds on dodging it, the spell
does half damage anyways. Just because it can:).

**Necromancy 1/5**
Ok edgelord I see you. The necromancy wizard is great when it comes to, well,
necromancy spells. Whenever the necromancy wizard kills a creature with a leveled
necromancy spell, they can reap some of the life essence from the target, gaining
some hp in return.

##### Sorcerer 4/5
The neppobaby of the spell casters. Sorcerers are born magic users. They are
incredibly powerful magic users with a wide variety of damage and supportive spells.
Sorcerers are a little more difficult to master, but in my opinion (noah) a lot of fun.
What differentiates Sorcerers from wizards is their metamagic, which makes them
able to alter the spell slightly for some extra effects. Sorcerers are a great choice if
you want to play a spell caster that is a little more challenging but with some
amazing effects!
What is metamagic?
Metamagic is a skill exclusive to the sorcerer. As stated before, it makes the sorcerer
able to alter spells cast in various ways. You can make the spell do more damage, or
target 2 targets, or make the spell quiet for a stealthy attack. This is what helps the
sorcerer be so diverse, but it's also what makes it more difficult.
Pros:
- Very versatile
- Can do big pp damage
- The backstory potential is huge
Cons:
- Resource reliant
- High skill floor

###### Archetypes
**Aberrant 2/5**
The aberrant sorcerer is all about telepathy and mind control. Want to finally know
what others are thinking about you? Then you'll love this archetype! You can form a
telepathic connection with another person or creature. You can communicate as long
as you speak the same language. It's great for roleplay!

**Storm 1/5**
Want to live the fantasy of being descended from hurricane catrina? The storm
sorcerer has some inbuilt mobility after casting a spell. They can fly a few feet after
casting a leveled spell. Pretty neat.

**Wild Magic 4/5**
For the chaos gremlins. The wild magic sorcerer is gambling incarnate. If you cast a
sorcerer spell, there is a chance that you have a “wild magic surge”. This makes you
roll on the wild magic table. A d100 to be exact. This surge causes a random effect
to leave your body. This effect can be really useful, or very bad. But that's what
makes it fun!.

##### Druid 5/5
Okay, furry. I'M KIDDING. Druid is in my opinion the most difficult spellcaster, but one
of the most fun ones. Druid is a shapeshifter class. They can transform into
creatures of the wild. But depending on the archetype, they can perhaps transform
into something else? Druid is very versatile. They can be a beefy frontline thanks to
their wild shape, or a supportive spellcaster in the back thanks to their spells. They
are the most versatile caster in the entire class system, but they are also the most
difficult. I don't recommend playing them as your first character, but if you are up for
a challenge, they could be incredibly fun! Furry….
What is wilshape?
Wildshape allows the druid to transform. Every Druid can use it to transform into an
animal. While they are an animal, they can't cast any spells, but they can attack as if
they are that animal and use their spellslots to heal themselves so they can stay
longer in the wildshape. Depending on the archetype, you can also transform into
something else. But more on that later
Pros:
- Incredibly versatile
- Great in almost any situation
- If played well, can carry the team
Cons:
- Very high skill floor
- If played incorrectly, can feel lackluster

###### Archetypes
**Land 3/5**
The circle of land druid focuses more on spellcasting than wildshape. They gain their
power from the land they hail from. This already helps with character building. The
circle of land druid can expend one wildshape charge to do a magic attack. This
attack spawns a sphere of thorns that sap away the life force of your enemies.
Another creature in that same sphere can heal de damage you did, so its a great
option for your melee companions.

**moon 3/5**
The circle of moon druid focuses more on the actual wildshape part of your kit.
Whenever you cast wildshape on yourself and turn into an animal you gain some
benefits. For example, the animal you can turn into can be a more challenging
animal then you can usually turn into. you also become way more tanky. So if the
whole turning into animal part of the druid suits you, this archetype is recommended!
Furry…..

**spores 4/5**
If the whole turning into animals thing isn't really your style, but you still want to be a
melee menace, this archetype is for you. The circle of spores druid is an amazing
frontline spellcaster. They can turn themselves into a spore master!... Yeah do
whatever you want with that information…. They permanently have a halo of spores
around them and if anyone gets to close, you can detonate them. This class is great
of you want to live the fantasy of a druid who does more with a stick than with spells.
## Species
Next up your species! Each species grant some extra species-specific abilities. Each species can play any class, but there are slight preferences if you care about being powerful.
#### Human
The classic human, humans are known for their versatility and resourcefulness, they gain proficiency in a variety of skills and can choose 1 from a long list of abilities known as Origin Feats. On top of that they gain the ability to reroll any roll of the die once per day.

Class Preferences: Slight preference to martial classes but all classes work perfectly fine.
#### Dwarf
Dwarfs are smaller humanoids, they are known for their resilience, affinity to masonry and their iron gut. Dwarfs gain resistance to poisons, and gain even more health per level. Additionally their affinity to masonry allows them to activate a tremorsense allowing them to see while blinded, as long as they are touching a stone surface.

Class Preferences: Barbarian, Paladin, Fighter, Cleric
#### Elf
Elves are magical and elegant humanoids, often tall and wearing regal attire. They are resisted to magic that puts them to sleep or charms them and have keen senses allowing them to spot things others wont. Because they decend from the fey they have a natural affinity to magic, allowing them to cast spells depending on their lineage, below are the 3 lineages (each will have their specific class preferences)

- **Drow** (Rogue, Ranger, Sorcerer, Monk)
	- Also known as 'Dark Elves', they live underground and because of that gain the ability to see even further into the dark than elves already can. They also gain the ability to cast some light and dark related spells.
- **High Elf** (Wizard, Warlock, Sorcerer, Cleric)
	- These are the noble-elves, and one of the more common depictions of elves. Due to their ancestral knowledge they gain the ability to cast some wizard spells and teleport short distances.
- **Wood Elf** (Ranger, Druid, Monk)
	- These elves live in the woods (suprising I know), they are attuned to nature and use that power to fuel their magic. They gain some druidic spells and can quickly travel long distances through the wilds.
#### Tiefling
Tieflings are infernal humanoids, they are either the child of a devil and humanoid parent, or their birth was cursed by these fiends. Often seen as heretical creatures they are shunned from society, luckily their devilish tongue still allows them to thrive in social circles. Similar to elves they have 3 different infernal lineages granting different abilities:
- **Abyssal** 
	- These tieflings gain their lineage of disease devils, granting resistances to poison, and spells to manipulate the battlefield, and poison enemies.
- **Chthonic**
	- Chthonic tieflings hold power of the fabric of life and death, granting resistances to dark magics and being able to harness these magics for their own gain.
- **Infernal**
	- These are the more classical depiction of devils: hellfire and brimstone. They gain resistance to fire and can harness powerful fiery spells to overwhelm their opponents.
The different lineages dont really influence class preference.
Class Preference: Warlock, Sorcerer, Rogue
#### Dragonborn
Contrary to popular belief, these are not half-dragons or something of the sort. They are simply humanoids that resemble dragons or drakes. They come in a variety of different colours, each colour assigned to a different element, altering their breath weapon and granting different resistances.  You can also channel your draconic nature to channel spectral wings to fly for a short duration.

Class Preference: Any martial class, Paladin, Sorcerer, Cleric
#### Halfling
Hobbits!  but under a different name for copy-right reasons, they are even shorter than dwarves. Their short stature, however, does not diminish their bravery as they are very hard to frighten. On top of that they are quite nimble due to their small size, fitting into places most other creatures fail to do. Their main selling point is their almost supernatural luck, seemingly being able to bend the rules of chance to their will. They do have one downside, due to their little legs, they are a bit slower than most other species.

Class Preference: Any Caster, Monk, Rogue, Ranger, Fighter
#### Gnome
Garden Gnomes!! These creatures are a bit odd as they are essentially more magically inclined dwarves. They excell at dodging and casting spells and are divided into 2 groups:
- Forest Gnomes
	- Similar to wood elves you gain the ability to cast some druidic spells and some minor illusionary magic.
- Rock  Gnomes
	- these gnomes are crafty inventors being able to repair, and create tiny clockwork devices. These devices can serve all sorts of purposes.
Class Preferences: All Spellcasters

#### Goliath
Goliaths are descendents from the giants, and this is very visable from their stature. They are tall, muscular and vigorous creatures. Their size makes them hard to restrain, and even harder to topple, they can even channel their giant's might to grow even larger and stronger. Additionally they gain an ability depending on their ancestor:
- **Cloud Giant**
	- These goliaths can teleport short distances to reposition on the battlefield
- **Fire Giant**
	- You infuse your strikes with fire dealing extra damage
- **Frost Giant**
	- Deals extra frost damage and slows enemies they hit with their attacks.
- **Hill Giant**
	- These golliaths use their large stature to topple their foes and force them on their backs.
- **Storm Giant**
	- Storm goliaths are volatile, being able to lash out with thunderous lashes when attacked.

Class Preference: Many of this species' abilities rely on attacks to be made, because of this they are Far better on martial classes or half casters such as Paladin and Ranger.

## Origins
These are somewhat complicated, and kinda arbitrary. So just make up a small background concept (2-4 sentences is fine). And i'll help pick the most suitable one.
