#general 
Previously Varias knew 3 gods, Jufica, Gavo and Quelaag. While these 3 still exist they have been changed, and their duties divided over some lesser gods.

Jufica, Gavo and Quelaag are known as Primarch Gods, each being at the head of a certain domain. Below them are lesser gods, also known as Seraphim. They rule more specific parts of a certain domain.

### The Three Primarchs
Once, they were mortals, the Divine Heroes who defied the will of the Volotheans. When the world was a twisted playground for eldritch horrors and the Great Beast **Zizaran** spread its nightmare across the land, these three heroes stood against the darkness.  
It was only through sacrifice that they triumphed. Their companion, **Korehn the Sylvean Mage**, gave her life to seal Zizaran’s corpse beneath the waves. But the battle had changed the survivors. In the remains of the fallen beast, they found power beyond mortality: power that would shape the world for eternity.  
Thus, they ascended, not just as gods but as the Primarchs, rulers of the newly formed Pantheon. To help govern creation, they shaped the Seraphim, divine servants and stewards of their will. These Seraphim act as both their emissaries and their enforcers, ensuring that each of their Primarchs’ visions is upheld across Varias.

As the first gods of the new Pantheon, Jufica, Gavo, and Quelaag stand as pillars of existence. They are not just divine beings; they are the architects of the world itself, the rulers of the Seraphim, and the forces that drive the cosmos forward.  
Each has shaped their own path, guiding their Seraphim and their worshippers while ensuring that the world of Varias does not fall into ruin once more.

### The Domain of Balance
#### Primarch Jufica
In life, Jufica was the mind of the Divine Heroes, the unwavering strategist. Every battle was planned, and every sacrifice calculated. Without her wisdom, the war against Zizaran would have collapsed into chaos.  
When she ascended, she took upon herself the greatest burden of all: to ensure that power never tipped too far in any direction. If creation flourished unchecked, it would spiral into reckless excess. If destruction reigned, existence would wither to nothingness. Thus, she stands at the center of all things, maintaining the fragile balance of the cosmos.  
Jufica is depicted as a tall, masked figure in flowing silver robes, six arms wielding chains that bind the planes together. Her face is unseen, for she is neither mortal nor divine. She is the law that holds existence itself.  
Her followers include judges, planar guardians, and those who seek enlightenment through pure rationality.

#### Lesser Gods
- **Chronis, Seraph of Time**  
    Time is the great tide, eternal, ceaseless, and indifferent to the will of gods and mortals alike. Chronis was not born but formed, a manifestation of the first moment that time was set in motion. He is said to walk both forward and backward, existing in all moments at once, yet bound by the necessity of progression. It is through his design that time cannot be unraveled, history cannot be rewritten, and the weight of consequence remains absolute. Those who attempt to subvert his laws through forbidden magics or reckless ambition often find themselves erased, as though they had never drawn breath at all.
- **Vaydris, Seraph of Justice**  
    Vaydris was once mortal, a warrior-judge who sought fairness in a world drowning in cruelty. When he perished at the hands of a tyrant whose trial he refused to forsake, Jufica lifted his broken body and reforged him in celestial fire. Now, his form is clad in a mask of burning silver, and his voice is the sound of ringing verdicts. He sees not with eyes but through the weight of truth, and to stand before him is to stand before the inevitability of judgment. His scales do not tip for morality, only for balance, ensuring that no action goes without its due consequence.
- **Aeris, Seraph of Harmony**  
    Aeris was once a mortal diplomat, a speaker of truths who walked the precarious threads between warring factions. When kingdoms burned and oaths shattered, she alone stood between ruin and reconciliation. But mortals refused balance, and in their arrogance, they silenced her voice, casting her into the abyss of forgotten names. Yet, the fabric of existence itself remembered, and from the depths of oblivion, Aeris rose again, not as a woman but as an immutable force. Now, she weaves the unseen threads that bind all things, ensuring that no power grows unchecked and no force consumes the other. She does not demand peace, only equilibrium, and those who tip the scales too far will find her hand guiding them back, whether through wisdom or destruction.
- **Talos, Seraph of Boundaries**  
    Talos is the sentinel of reality, the unseen warden standing at the edges of all worlds. He is faceless and voiceless, an entity clad in shifting obsidian armor, its surface etched with the runes of forbidden passage. His duty is not simply to protect realms from intrusion but to ensure that the horrors beyond the veil remain forever imprisoned. It is whispered that the Dark Three once sought to unmake him, for his existence keeps their influence contained. Yet Talos does not falter, for he is not a being of choice. He is the wall between the known and the unknowable, the last gate that must never be opened.

### The Domain of Life

#### Primarch Quelaag
Before her ascension, Quelaag was a warrior without equal, the deadliest of the Divine Heroes. She did not fear battle; she understood it and embraced it. Death was not an end, but a necessity, a force that ensured only the strong and the worthy remained.  
When she touched the remains of Zizaran, she saw the truth: existence cannot be endless growth. Death, decay, and rebirth are the forces that allow the world to move forward. Without them, stagnation would rot existence from within.  
As the Primarch of Decay, she destroys not for pleasure but for purpose. The old must fall so that the new may rise. She despises the undead, for they are an affront to the cycle she oversees, a perversion of death’s true purpose.  
Quelaag is depicted as a black-haired woman in tattered, bride-like robes, her skeletal face veiled in darkness. A golden halo, like a cracked sun, floats behind her head, and six black wings extend from her back.  
Her followers include druids who understand the necessity of decay, monster hunters who destroy the undead, and even assassins who believe in death as a sacred duty.

#### Lesser Gods
- **Thaniviel, Seraph of Finality**  
    Thaniviel is not the harbinger of death, nor does he revel in it. He is simply the end that must come. Where life flourishes, he waits in quiet patience, knowing that all things must, in time, meet his embrace. He does not carry a blade, for he does not kill; he merely arrives, unseen and unheard, yet undeniable. He is said to stand at the edges of battlefields, in the breath of the dying, in the silence that follows a life's final whisper. Those who fear him do not understand him, for Thaniviel does not punish, he frees, guiding souls into the next journey beyond mortal comprehension.
- **Sylvanas, Seraph of Fertility**  
    Sylvanas is the first breath of spring, the soft hum of the earth waking from slumber, the warmth of a newborn's cry. She is life in its most gentle yet unrelenting form, for where she treads, the barren becomes lush and the desolate teems with new beginnings. Yet she is not merely a goddess of birth; she is the harvester, the weaver of cycles. Where she sows, she also reaps, ensuring that for all things born, a time shall come for them to return to the soil. Those who seek her favor in times of famine pray with open hands, but those who refuse to yield to nature’s rhythm find their lands turned to ashen dust.
- **Myrlin, Seraph of Change**  
    To fear change is to fear existence itself, and Myrlin is the relentless tide of transformation that sweeps away stagnation. Once a mortal scholar who sought to defy fate itself, Myrlin’s insatiable curiosity led them to consume the wisdom of the gods, reshaping themselves into something beyond flesh. They are depicted as a being of ever-shifting form, their voice layered with countless others, speaking in tongues both ancient and yet to be written. Myrlin teaches that to resist change is to invite ruin, and those who cling too tightly to what is are often shattered by the force of what will be.
- **Astiel, Seraph of Deception**  
    To some, deception is an act of malice. To Astiel, it is the foundation of reality itself. Truth is fragile, perception is a lie, and those who believe in absolutes are merely victims of a more skillful illusion. Astiel was once a prophet who saw too much, who understood that the world is not as it seems, that even the gods themselves wear masks. When their revelations grew too dangerous, they were unmade and stripped of identity, their form forever obscured beneath layers of shifting veils. Now, they are the patron of illusionists, of whispered secrets, of the stories that reshape reality itself. Truth is but a flickering shadow; in Astiel’s name, it is ever rewritten.

### **The Dark Three**
- **Bane, Seraph of Tyranny**
- **Bhaal, Seraph of Murder**
- **Myrkul, Seraph of Bones**

Before their ascension to terrible divinity, the ones now feared as Myrkul, Bhaal, and Bane were mere mortals, born of suffering, raised in shadow, and sharpened by the cruel hand of fate within the depths of Nulbraith. Each was a master of a forbidden craft, pushing the limits of mortal capability in pursuit of power beyond reckoning.
#### **Myrkul, the Pale Lich**
Myrkul, once a scholar of esoteric rites, was said to have delved so deeply into the whispers of the forgotten gods that he no longer belonged fully to the realm of the living. Legends claim that a fragment of a Volothean spirit, lingering in the seams of reality, took notice of his relentless hunger for knowledge. It spoke to him through the idols of Nulbraith’s temples, unraveling the secrets of unlife in a tongue only the truly damned could comprehend. Myrkul abandoned his mortal form long before his apotheosis. His soul withered into something neither alive nor dead, a walking entropy that eroded all life around him.
#### **Bhaal, the Red Shadow**
Bhaal was death incarnate, not in the grand spectacle of war, but in the quiet inevitability of the blade in the dark. Unlike the others, his power was not in sorcery or rule, but in the simple truth that all things die when struck well enough. He was a master assassin, a living terror whose name was never spoken aloud. To his victims, he was but a fleeting shape, felt only in the last, sharp moment before oblivion. His cruelty was not sadism, nor rage; it was purpose. He viewed murder as the highest calling, believing that through slaughter, he might carve a path to something greater. And perhaps, in the depths of the Waking Dream, something answered.
#### **Bane, the Black Tyrant**
If Myrkul was the cold inevitability of death and Bhaal the silent executioner, then Bane was dominion itself. Once a warlord within Nulbraith, he ruled not through wisdom but through the sheer, unyielding force of will. He crushed dissent as easily as one might snuff out a candle, seeing mercy as weakness and submission as the only true virtue. His presence alone bent men to their knees. Even before his ascension, some whispered that he had ceased to be merely mortal, that something vast and formless had burrowed into his soul, whispering secrets of cosmic conquest.
### **The Ascension: A Bargain in the Dark**
None can say for certain how the Dark Three rose beyond mortality. All who tell the tale speak of a night when Nulbraith itself shuddered.

A presence descended upon them,a remnant of a Volothean long thought lost to time. Unlike the others, it had not abandoned the world. It had waited. It had watched as mortals scurried and struggled in their insignificance. It had seen the potential for something more. The Dark Three, in their cruelty, their ambition, and their complete rejection of mortal limitation, had caught its attention.

It is said that the Volothean spirit offered no bargain,only revelation.
For one fleeting moment, they glimpsed beyond the veil of their prison-world. They saw their own truth, stripped of flesh and limit, stripped of all but hunger and will. And then, they were no longer men.
### **The Binding of the Dark Three**
Upon their ascension, the Dark Three became a force that even the gods feared. They did not rule as the other divinities did, through worship and dominion, but through pure, unrelenting force. They scarred Varias, reveling in their newfound power. Their every act was a defiance against the silence of the abandoned world.

It was Jufica, the Goddess of Balance and Fate, who stood against them. She did not fight as the warrior gods might. She did not plead as the weaker deities would. Instead, she sealed away fragments of their power, weaving the chains of their own essence into the tapestry of fate itself.
- Myrkul’s dominion over death was shackled, ensuring that true undeath would always bear decay. No soul could be held in perfect eternity.
- Bhaal’s artistry of slaughter was limited, ensuring that no killing blow would ever be inescapable. The hunted might still find a moment to fight or flee.
- Bane’s grip over dominion was frayed, forcing all empires, no matter how absolute, to eventually crack and crumble under time’s weight.

But even now, their influence remains. The chains of Jufica are not unbreakable. And in the quiet corners of the world, there are those who whisper the Dark Three’s names, longing for the day when the bindings unravel and the Heralds of the Forsaken Will rise once more.

### **The Domain of Creation**

#### **Primarch Gavo**
Once, Gavo was a brilliant builder and craftsman, the one who forged the relics and weapons that the Divine Heroes needed to win their war. His hands shaped fortresses to protect the innocent, and his mind envisioned wonders that had never been seen before.

When he ascended, he embraced his true calling, not just as a creator of tools, but as a god who fosters all creation. It is through him that life flourishes, civilizations rise, and the world constantly moves forward. Innovation, cooperation, and growth are his gifts to mortals.

Gavo is depicted as a towering figure with a mane-like beard of molten metal and hands calloused from endless work. His presence is felt wherever progress is made: on the anvils of blacksmiths, in the blueprints of architects, and in the laughter of a child taking their first steps.

His followers include blacksmiths, scholars, engineers, and anyone who believes in the boundless potential of creation.
#### **Lesser Gods**
- **Darynth, Seraph of Inspiration**  
    Darynth is the whisper in the sculptor’s ear, the flicker of insight before ink touches parchment, and the unexplainable spark of creation that drives mortals to make something from nothing. Legends say he was once a wandering bard who sought to capture the essence of the cosmos in a single song. When his mortal form failed him, his spirit lived on, spreading embers of his unfinished masterpiece into the hearts of artists, inventors, and dreamers alike. Now, he moves unseen, with his presence marked by sudden revelations and feverish creativity. Yet inspiration is a fickle gift, and those who do not act upon it may find it withering into regret.
- **Luctor, Seraph of Community**  
    Luctor is the unseen force that binds people together, the warmth of shared burdens and the strength of many hands lifting as one. In life, he was a nameless guardian and a protector who gave everything for his people. His name was erased so that the legacy of his people would endure. When he was slain, his body was carried by a thousand hands. His spirit refused to fade so long as mortals still stood shoulder to shoulder. Now, his presence is felt in the laughter of feasts, the sorrow of shared grief, and the unyielding resolve of those who stand together against the tide of despair. Those who betray their kin or break sacred bonds find themselves abandoned by his blessing, left adrift and forgotten.
- **Aurelion, Seraph of Knowledge**  
    Aurelion is both keeper and tempter, the guardian of wisdom and its greatest danger. Once a scholar who sought all knowledge, he uncovered truths that should never have been known. These secrets burned away his mortality and left him forever bound to the burden of truth. Now, he watches over vast troves of knowledge, ensuring that wisdom flows where it is needed while withholding that which could unravel existence. He does not judge knowledge as good or evil, but only as necessary or catastrophic. Those who seek him must prove themselves worthy, or else be driven mad by the weight of what they learn.
- **Thraxis, Seraph of Forge and Fire**  
    Also known as the Seraph of Steel, Thraxis was once a humble blacksmith who forged weapons for both heroes and tyrants alike. When he was betrayed by a king who feared the power of his craft, Thraxis cast himself into his own forge. His soul fused with the molten metal. Now, he walks among the flames. His presence is felt in the rhythmic strike of hammer on anvil and in the roaring heart of every forge. He does not create for war or for peace, but only for purpose. He blesses those who forge with intent and punishes those who treat craftsmanship with careless greed. Some say that when the world is on the brink of ruin, he will return wielding the first blade he ever forged, an unbreakable weapon that knows no master.
