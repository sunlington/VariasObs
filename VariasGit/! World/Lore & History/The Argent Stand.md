### **I. Prelude to Ruin**

In the waning centuries following the Sundering, when the scars of creation yet festered and the world had not fully healed, there arose once more the shadow of **the Black Grail**. Its cult spread in silence and in blood, sowing heresy among the desperate and the fallen. Gates long sealed were weakened, and whispers of **[[Gehenna]]** returned to the dreams of mortals.

The [[Argent Vigil]]], sworn watchers of the abyss, recognized the signs as no mere resurgence, but an echo of the ancient calamity. Thus the Silver Council declared a full muster, calling banners from every sanctum and stronghold. What followed would be known in later ages as **the Argent Stand**, the greatest trial of the Vigil since its founding.

### **II. The March of Silver**

For seven years the Silvered Host waged war across Alziria. Cities were reclaimed at grievous cost, cult strongholds burned, and entire bloodlines erased to halt the spread of corruption. The Vigil did not pause to count the dead, for the enemy showed no mercy, and neither could they.

Among the champions of this war stood **Sir Kas of the Vigil**, renowned for his valor and unshakable faith, and **[[Sir Placiduas]]**, whose resolve was said to be as tempered as his blade. Together they led assaults where none others would stand, striking not merely at armies, but at the sources of the Grail’s power.

Yet as the war dragged on, it became evident that victory in the material realm would not suffice. The corruption endured. [[The Black Grail]] had anchored itself beyond mortal reach.

### **III. The Descent into Gehenna**

By decree of the Silver Council, a final and desperate stratagem was enacted. A chosen host—knights, inquisitors, and sanctified scholars—would breach the abyss itself and sever the Grail at its source. None believed they would return.

The crossing into **Gehenna** was accomplished through rites now sealed and forbidden, their full details struck from all surviving records. What is known is this: the abyss resisted, and the cost was immeasurable. Many were lost before battle was even joined.

Within that accursed realm, the Vigil confronted the manifested horror of the Black Grail and its legions. The conflict raged beyond the measure of days or nights. Reality itself was said to fray beneath the weight of divine wrath and abyssal defiance.

At last, the Grail was shattered, its form broken, its power dispersed. The gate was sealed, and Gehenna cut from the world once more.

Thus the Vigil stood victorious.

### **IV. The Return of the Survivors**

Of the host that entered Gehenna, only a handful returned. They emerged scarred in body and spirit, marked by trials no chronicler could fully capture. Chief among them was **Sir Kas**, bearing his blade darkened and his countenance altered.

The Vigil proclaimed the Stand a triumph. Bells rang, and the faithful rejoiced. Yet it was noted—even in these early accounts—that Kas did not share in the celebration. He spoke little, prayed less, and was often found alone, staring into nothing.

It is recorded that he claimed the war was “_not ended, merely displaced_.” Such words were attributed to trauma and soon dismissed.

### **V. The Tragedy of Sir Kas**

In the years that followed, Sir Kas turned against his brethren. What madness seized him is a matter of grave theological debate, and speculation is discouraged. The official doctrine holds that prolonged exposure to Gehenna corrupted his spirit beyond salvation.

Kas slaughtered those who came to restrain him, staining sacred halls with silvered blood. His rampage ended only when **Sir Placiduas** confronted him in single combat.

Their duel is remembered as one of sorrow rather than glory. Placiduas struck Kas down, yet refused to grant him final rest. Through rites of binding and penance, Kas’s tormented soul was sealed within his own blade, lest his corruption escape into the world.

The weapon was henceforth known as **the [[Sword of Kas]]**, and was placed under eternal ward.

---

### **VI. On the Silence Thereafter**

With Kas’s fall, the Argent Stand was declared concluded. The Black Grail was pronounced broken, Gehenna sealed, and the Vigil reaffirmed in its sacred purpose. Monuments were raised, names inscribed, and the world moved forward.

Yet certain matters were never again addressed in open council.

Fragments of testimony were sealed. Entire journals vanished. Some among the Sanctified would later note that the corruption encountered in Gehenna did not bear the mark of demon or fiend alone, but of something older—something unnamed.

These passages have since been removed.

---

### **VII. Final Accounting**

The Argent Stand remains a testament to the Vigil’s resolve: that even in the face of annihilation, humanity may yet endure through faith, steel, and sacrifice.

That the cost was great cannot be denied.

That all was truly won is a matter left, wisely, unexamined.

_By Silver and Flame, the Dark was banished._  
So the Annals record.
