## The Seven Layers of Gehenna
Gehenna is divided into different layers, each more perilous than the last. There are a seemingly infinite number of layers, seven of which have structure, each lead by one of the serpent lords from [[The Black Grail]]. Past these 7 layers even the lords cannot create (stable) structure.
### 1st Layer - The Maw of Khaldrith
A nightmarish wasteland of endless hunger and decayed excess, this realm is filled with grotesque feasts where nothing satisfies and gnawing starvation that never fades. Ruined cities of bone and bloated corpses sink into swamps of bile and filth, while rivers of molten fat flow through the land. The damned gorge themselves until they burst, only to be reborn and repeat their torment. Khaldrith the Devourer sits upon a throne of fused bodies, forever consuming yet never full.

### 2nd Layer - The Cauldron of Drazgul
A realm of slow, creeping decay, where the air is thick with disease, and the land is a rotting carcass. The sickly light of Gehenna filters through an eternal fog of pestilence. The ground is a writhing mass of decomposing flesh, and entire cities have collapsed into necrotic swamps. The souls here rot in their own apathy, unable to muster the will to escape their fate. Drazgul the Plaguebringer rules from his seething mound of filth, his bloated body birthing new horrors with every breath.

### 3rd Layer - The Crimson Wastes of Azkallith
A battlefield soaked in eternal bloodshed, where war never ceases and rage is an unquenchable fire. The sky is a seething storm of smoke and embers, and the ground quakes with the endless march of berserk legions. War cries echo through the canyons, and rivers of blood carve through the land. The souls trapped here are doomed to fight, die, and rise again in an endless cycle of fury. Azkallith the Burning Hate dwells in a fortress of molten iron, her laughter ringing over the eternal carnage.

### 4th Layer - The Veil of Nyxarael
A labyrinthine city of mirrored halls and shifting illusions, where beauty and status are weapons, and desire is never fulfilled. The damned here are cursed to covet what they see but never possess it—eternal rivals locked in cycles of comparison, jealousy, and sabotage. The Veil itself changes constantly, reflecting the ambitions of those who dwell within. Nyxarael the Covetous Muse drapes herself in stolen grandeur, inciting envy with every word, her whispered promises twisting hearts into daggers.

### 5th Layer - The Sable Gardens of Silivex
A shadowed paradise of carnal intrigue and seductive manipulation, where temptation is the coin of the realm. The gardens bloom with flowers that speak in moans, and the trees bear fruit that induces hallucinations of desire. The damned are caught in a web of passion and deceit, losing themselves in an endless spiral of obsession and indulgence. Silivex the Hidden Fang now dons the guise of pleasure, drawing mortals in with a sensual allure before devouring their souls behind closed veils and velvet masks.

### 6th Layer - The Abyss of Thalverix
A vast, hollow chasm of empty vaults and shattered riches, where mountains of cursed gold burn with cold fire. The damned hoard what they cannot keep, their bodies turning to stone as they clutch their treasures. Towers of obsidian stretch into the darkness, filled with lost souls who sought power and wealth but found only ruin. Thalverix the Soul Reaper prowls the shadows, feasting on the despair of those who would give anything for just one more coin.

### 7th Layer - The Throne of Vorthrax
The seat of ultimate dominion and tyranny, where the Black Grail’s influence is strongest. A massive, dead city of towering obsidian spires stretches endlessly, ruled with absolute order. The souls here are enslaved to a system of cruel hierarchies, eternally clawing for power they will never attain. The sky is a cracked void, through which a great black sun looms, radiating Vorthrax’s suffocating will. He reigns from his Iron Citadel, an unbreakable bastion from which he watches all, the final architect of Gehenna’s suffering.
