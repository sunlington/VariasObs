## Overview
The Aelithian expanse is not only a continent, it is an accord of sovereign nations. Bound by shared history and the scar of a cataclysmic war. They are united by the [[Skybound Concord]], a non-binding council based aboard the legendary flying citadel ship [[The Everreach]]. Ensuring peace, trade and vigilance.

## The 4 Nations
As noted above each of the 4 nations work together under the watchful eyes of the [[Skybound Concord]]. However they are not without conflict. If such a conflict arose they must fight it out amongst themselves and none of the other nations are to intervene unless ordered to do so by the [[Skybound Concord | concord]]. Each of these nations are found on different isles and are connected by [[The Everreach]], a giant citadel-ship which forms a neutral ground between each of the countries, and also as a ferry between the isles.
