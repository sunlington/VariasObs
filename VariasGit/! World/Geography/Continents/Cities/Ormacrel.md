_An Account of the Western Malacorean Isles_  
by **Helvarn Doss**, Cartographer of the Third Concord

It must be understood at once: in Malacore, the ground does not rest.

Every isle of the nation floats. Children learn to walk upon stone that drifts above cloud and sea alike, and they learn early that such a fact is not remarkable. To the Malacorean mind, floating land is not a wonder—it is a condition, like weather or gravity elsewhere.

Ormacrel, then, is not a marvel because it stands above the world. It is notable because it stands **unmoved**.

### Founding and Purpose

Ormacrel was founded during the later years of the **Era of Consolidation**, when Malacore turned inward to govern what it had already secured. The isle upon which the city rests had long served as a military mustering ground, its bedrock unusually stable even by Malacorean standards. This reliability made it an ideal site for a civic center devoted not to conquest, but to continuity.

The city was designed to house administration, record-keeping, and inter-isle coordination. Where other Malacorean cities emphasize industry or soldiery, Ormacrel emphasizes **endurance through order**. It is here that treaties are archived, star-charts maintained, and the nation’s long memory preserved.

### Philosophy and Civic Character

Malacore holds to the belief that strength is not proven in moments of victory, but in years of survival. Ormacrel embodies this belief completely.

Its people speak plainly, build heavily, and distrust excess. Architecture favors reinforced stone bound with exposed steel supports. No structure is purely decorative; if something cannot justify its mass, it is removed. The city’s guiding principle is often summarized by a saying attributed to its first magistrate:

> _“If it lasts, it matters.  
> If it fails, we rebuild it better.”_

Faith, here, is practiced quietly. Shrines exist—usually carved into load-bearing walls rather than standing apart—but prayer is viewed as a private discipline. Public virtue is demonstrated through work, service, and restraint.

### The Shape of the City

Ormacrel is arranged in broad, concentric districts that follow the natural contours of the isle. Streets are wide and linear, allowing for the movement of caravans, troops, and construction engines. Balconies and overhangs are minimal; vertical space is used sparingly and only when structurally justified.

Unlike many cities on the Malacorean isles, Ormacrel makes no effort to conceal its edge. Sheer drop-offs are reinforced with iron parapets and massive chain-anchors, not to prevent the isle from drifting—Malacore has long mastered that art—but to remind citizens where their ground ends.

### Places of Note

**The Bastion Hall**  
The seat of Ormacrel’s governance and the administrative heart of western Malacore. The Bastion Hall is a massive, angular structure of dark stone and steel banding, its interior halls wide enough to march a cohort through. Here sit magistrates, military liaisons, and civic engineers. Decisions are delivered without flourish and recorded immediately.

**The Archive Annex**  
Attached to a larger, sealed archive complex, the Annex is the only portion open to scholars and officials without special clearance. Its shelves are built directly into the walls, and many volumes are secured by chain and clasp. Records concerning astral phenomena, inter-isle history, and certain foreign sites—such as Astryx Vale—are known to be inconsistent, though no archivist will comment on why.

**Starfall Market**  
A sunken trade district constructed of reinforced stone and steel arches, open to the sky. Ormacrel’s market is famed for its efficiency and fairness rather than abundance. At dusk, faint stellar fragments occasionally descend across the isles, striking metal surfaces with a sound like distant bells. Merchants pause briefly when this occurs, then resume business without remark.

**Milleric’s Crucible & Phials**  
Among the city’s most respected alchemical establishments, this shop is owned by **Patty Milleric**, a veteran alchemist whose reputation extends across multiple isles. Her shop is fortified against blast and spill alike, with heavy shutters and vented chimneys visible from the street. Milleric specializes in stabilizing volatile compounds and producing reliable, repeatable mixtures—qualities prized highly in Malacore. Adventurers are welcome customers, though she is known to refuse those she deems careless.

**Shrines of the Enduring Form**  
Rather than grand temples, Ormacrel maintains a series of small shrines dedicated to ideals rather than gods: Endurance, Clarity, Vigilance. Each is integrated into public infrastructure—beneath stairwells, within bridge supports, or along major thoroughfares. Offerings are rare; contemplation is expected to suffice.

### _On Soil, Green Things, and the Quiet Defiance of Life_

It would be a mistake to think Ormacrel, or Malacore as a whole, is only steel and stone.

The bedrock of the Malacorean isles is harsh, mineral-heavy, and resistant to cultivation. Early accounts describe gray plains and jagged rises where even moss struggled to take hold. That such ground now supports **rolling green hills, terraced fields, and wind-bent orchards** is not the result of fortune, but of labor sustained across generations.

Malacore did not ask the land to become fertile.  
It **forced the issue**, patiently.

Soil was ground from stone, enriched with ash, composted lichen, and the refuse of industry. Water was redirected through carved channels and cisterns, its flow measured with the same care as any military supply line. Entire guilds formed not around farming, but around **making land farmable**. To this day, Malacorean children learn the difference between _found soil_ and _made soil_.

In Ormacrel, greenery appears where it is most needed rather than where it is most pleasing. Courtyards host stubborn grass trimmed to regulation height. Vines crawl along steel supports, their growth subtly guided by wire and brace. Even the city’s outer parapets support planters of low shrubs and windflowers, their roots bound in reinforced beds.

And yet—there is joy here, if one knows where to look.

Some inhabitants keep personal gardens no larger than a shield, cultivating rare herbs or flowers whose only purpose is to exist. Old soldiers argue fiercely over whose tomatoes survived the longest frost. Children chalk constellation shapes onto paving stones and wait for moss to grow along the lines. On certain evenings, one may see citizens sitting silently beneath the stars, not in reverence, but in quiet satisfaction at having built something that can withstand them.

This, I am told, is Malacorean whimsy.

### _Addendum: The People Themselves_

Though outsiders often describe Malacoreans as severe, this judgment overlooks the **dry humor and quiet eccentricity** that flourishes beneath their discipline.

In Ormacrel, it is not uncommon to meet:

- A stonemason who names every block he sets
    
- An archivist who presses flowers between census pages
    
- A market guard who feeds birds only on days when it rains
    
- An alchemist who insists certain mixtures “work better if encouraged”
    

Such habits are not mocked. They are considered signs of longevity.
### Closing Observations

Ormacrel does not bloom by accident.

Every green thing here exists because someone decided it should, and refused to let the stone win. In this way, the city reveals a softer truth beneath its iron: that Malacore’s greatest strength is not its ability to endure the impossible, but its willingness to **make the impossible habitable**.

Where others build monuments to be admired, Malacore builds places to be lived in.

And in Ormacrel, high above the world, life persists not because it is easy—but because it is worth the effort.
