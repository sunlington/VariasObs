> "By Silver and Flame. We banish the Dark"

A militant order devoted to the unrelenting eradication of [[The Black Grail]]. The argent vigil is not merely a brotherhood of knight, but an inquisition, and a final bulwark against ruin. Clad in silvered steel and wielding consecrated arms, they exist for on singular purpose: To ensure that the horrors of [[Gehenna]] never claim the material plane.

To the faithful they are warrior-saints, the watchmen in the dark, guardians against unspeakable evil. To the wicked, they are fanatics, butchers and zealots, merciless in their pursuit of righteousness.

## Founding of the Vigil
The Argent Vigil was born from an age of despair. Centuries ago, in the aftermath of [[The Sundering]] , when [[The Black Grail]] first walked the earth freely, a coalition of desperate kings, wayward knights and broken clergy gathered to make one final stand against eh abyss. They did not expect victory only vengeance, to die so others might live. 
Yet, against all odds, they prevailed. Led by the legendary [[Saint Aurelian]], the last survivors of this coalition reforged themselves into an eternal order, one that would never allow [[The Black Grail]] to rise again. They took sacred oaths, donned silver as a symbol of their incorruptibility, and swore to remain ever watchful. Thus, the Argent Vigil was born: an undying legion of hunters and executioners.

## Structure of the Vigil
The Vigil is structures as a militant theocracy, its leadership is dictated by faith and merit rather than nobility.
- The High Templar, the supreme commander of the Vigil, chosen not by birth right but through trials of purity, faith and war. The current High Templar is [[Cassiel, the Silver Flame]], a warrior-priest who once served as a scholar before taking up the sword. 
- The Silver Council, A gathering of veteran inquisitors, grandmasters, and war-priests who dictate the strategies of the Vigil. They oversee deployments, inquisitions and purges.
- The Silvered Host, The main martial force of the Vigil, comprised of knights, inquisitors, and templars. They are the soldiers of the faith, clad in consecrated armour, wielding silver-forged weapons, and blessed to withstand corruption.
- The Penitent Legion, Comprised of redeemed heretics, exiles and those seeking atonement, the penitent legion is sent on the most dangerous and suicidal missions. Their lives are forfeit, but they may yet earn redemption through fire and blood.
- The Sanctified, Healers exorcists and scholars who seek to understand the enemy, using knowledge as both a weapon and a shield.
- The Inquisition, The darkest arm of the Vigil, composed of those who hunt corruption within their own ranks. They are ruthless, feared even by their own brothers, for their duty often requires them to strike first, and question later.

## Tenets of the Vigil
1. The Eternal Watch, *"[[The Black Grail]] does not sleep, nor shall we. We are the first line of defence against the abyss, and we shall never stand down.*
2. No Mercy for the Wicked,  *"To bargain with evil is to be consumed by it. Those we traffic in heresy must be purged, lest their corruption spread."*
3. Silver is the Purifier, *"We must remain steadfast, unwavering, incorruptible. Just as silver burns the profane, so too must we burn away weakness within ourselves"*
4. The Light Endures, *"We are not saviours. We are not conquerors. We are the last hope in the dark. We do not break"*
5. [[The Black Grail]] Must be Destroyed, *"No price is too high, no sacrifice too great. The enemy must not be allowed to rise again."*

## Notable Relics of the Vigil
- The Argent Tome, A vast and forbidden tome containing the collected knowledge of all things demonic, abyssal and unholy. it is both a weapon and a curse, for to read too deeply is to risk damnation.
- The Black Chalice, A relic once stolen from [[The Black Grail]] itself, containing a fraction of their abyssal power. Kept under eternal guard, it is both a trophy and a reminder, the war is never over.
