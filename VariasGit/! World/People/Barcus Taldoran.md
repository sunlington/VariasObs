### **Traits**

**Soulforged Arsenal.**  
Barcus wields the _Arcanite Grimoire_, a tome containing fragments of his soul. As a bonus action, he can conjure or dismiss up to **two** golden spectral weapons (swords or spears). They orbit him or hover within 30 ft. and count as magical weapons.

**Bound Step (Recharge 4–6).**  
As part of his movement or as a reaction to being targeted by an attack, Barcus teleports up to 40 ft. to an unoccupied space he can see. If used as a reaction, the attack automatically misses.

**Will of Arcanite.**  
Once per turn when Barcus hits with a _Spectral Blade_, he deals an extra 7 (2d6) radiant damage.

**Veteran’s Instincts.**  
Barcus has advantage on initiative rolls and cannot be surprised while conscious.

---

### **Actions**

**Multiattack.**  
Barcus makes two _Spectral Blade_ attacks.

**Spectral Blade (Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack).**  
+7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30 ft., one target.  
_Hit:_ 10 (2d8 + 2) force damage.  
The blade vanishes after striking and reforms in his grasp or orbit.

**Command Blades (Recharge 5–6).**  
Barcus commands both spectral weapons to strike independently at targets within 30 ft. Each makes a _Spectral Blade_ attack at +7 to hit.  
If both attacks hit the same creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

**Golden Barrage (Recharge 6).**  
Barcus releases his weapons in a whirling burst. Each creature of his choice within 15 ft. must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success. The blades vanish after this attack; he must re-summon them with _Soulforged Arsenal_.

---

### **Bonus Actions**

**Soulforged Arsenal (1/Turn).**  
Summon or reposition up to two spectral weapons within 30 ft.

**Tactical Shift.**  
Teleport up to 20 ft. to an unoccupied space he can see.

---

### **Reactions**

**Bound Step (Recharge 4–6).**  
When targeted by an attack, Barcus teleports up to 40 ft. to a visible space. The attack misses automatically.

### **Combat Behavior / DM Notes**

- **Opening:** He begins fights at range, blades floating protectively. Uses _Command Blades_ early to test enemies.
    
- **Mobility:** Teleports constantly, using terrain to his advantage — rarely in the same place twice.
    
- **Tactics:** Fights intelligently, aiding allies with positioning and exploiting openings.
    
- **Morale:** If the fight looks unwinnable or the players prove their intentions, he disengages rather than fight to the death.

### **Roleplaying in Battle**

When your players fight alongside him, make his presence _cinematic_, not dominant.

- Describe how he _flashes between positions_, his blades spiraling outward like golden comets.
    
- Let him **finish off weakened foes** or **cover retreats**, not steal kills.
    
- Occasionally have him call out tactical commands:
    
    > “Left flank — now! Keep them pinned, I’ll cut their retreat!”
    

He should feel like the grizzled veteran who’s _seen too much_ but still fights with frightening grace — a living reminder of what a Soulforged Lance once was.
