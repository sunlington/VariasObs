Within Antaria in a city called Bruxela near the mountains of Seieco, the party is summoned by a secretive branch of the [[Court of Luctor]]. to investigate a string of mass disappearances in the outer districts. People banish without signs of struggle, leaving only their clothes and personal belongings, neatly folded.
A local legend says these victims are dragged down by something deep beneath the city.

## Chapter 1, The Mindless
In their investigations they gain the following clues:
- Unnatural Dreams: Witnesses (especially mages, warlocks and psionics) have nightmares of a collosal mirror with purple/pink eyes, whispering envious thoughs in a chorus of voices.
- Survivor: One person who returned speaks in riddles, claiming they "Saw themselves reflected bu were someone else" and "Sang in the choir of sleeping teeth" They're slowly losing memory and identity.
- Weird Mirrors: Mirrors briefly move differently or speak truths characters dont want to hear, feeding their insecurities. These whispers escalate.

Their investigation leads them to a long-abandoned Cohors Mechanica research facility beneath Bruxela. They find:
- Ritual Diagrams mixing necromantic and psionic energy, centering on emeotional suppresion and replication.
- A failed prototype of the immortality system used now by the new legionnaries, still thethered to an active emotional siphon.
- A door sealed in a magical barrier, only opening when a PC confronts their own envy, regret or insecurity.
Behind  that final door they find a map of old tunnels, an archaic path that leads into the deeper depths. It is labeled, in an ancient tongue: "To [[Nulbriath]], sanctuary of the eyeless".
