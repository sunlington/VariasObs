**Weapon (longsword), Artifact (required attunement) 1d8(1d10) versatile.** 

*Once the blade of a legendary knight of The Argent Vigil, Sir Kas was a hero of [[The Argent Stand]], his courage unmatched as he carried the fight beyond the battlefield into the very depths of Gehenna. But Gehenna does not suffer mortals to leave unchanged. The abyssal horrors seeped into his soul, twisting him in ways even he could not perceive.* 
*He returned, believing the final gate had been sealed alongside his brethren. Yet, the true war raged on, not in the world, but within him. And it was a war he was losing. The corruption festered, whispering, gnawing, until Kas no longer saw his comrades as allies, but as enemies. When the madness took hold, he turned his blade upon those he once called brothers. Their blood bathed him in crimson as he became the very thing he once swore to destroy.* 
*For a time, he roamed the lands of Alziria as a scourge, a nightmare given form. It was not until Sir Placiduas, another noble warrior of The Argent Vigil, stood against him that his rampage was finally ended. In their fateful duel, Placiduas struck him down, but death was not the end. With a solemn vow, he sealed Kas’ tormented soul within his own cursed blade, forever binding his wrath and madness to the steel.* 
*The once-radiant silver of the sword blackened, its purity lost to abyssal corruption. What remains is no longer the weapon of a hero, but a relic of tragedy, The Sword of Kas, a bloodstained legacy of a fallen champion.*
