# Running this Chapter
This chapter is focused on roleplay, with themes of morality and faction building. It marks the emotional comedown after a harrowing escape from [[Gehenna]] and sets a stage for a long-term ideological conflict.

This chapter is split into different sections, depending on what escape method they chose: [[Descend, Overview#Escape Routes]]

## Path of The Ascended
### Goals
- Introduce [[The Silver City]], a pristine and tranquil space that feels disturbingly perfect.
- Introduce the  [[Sculptor]].
- Present a genuine temptation, whether to join the [[Ascended]], walk away, or oppose them.
- Provide long-term consequences tied to their choices (ascension, demon hunting, creating enemies).

5. **Departure**

### Key Locations
#### Arrival Gates
Marble arches etched with abyssal glyphs are guarded by Ascended who examine the emotional and moral resonance of visitors. Characters who resist or are unworthy may experience vivid hallucinations reflecting their guilt or shame. 
#### Garden of Quiet Truth
A geometric courtyard filled with mirrored flora. Flowers bloom in perfect symmetry. The whispers from petals murmur answers to questions players have not spoken aloud.

**Asher:** "While all companions are trapped, they are not unmoving."

**Artemis:** "Smoke once more comes from the factory chimneys"

**Aurelia:**  "The Source of your Anguish lies north!"

**Aeryth:** "The Great drake lives."

#### Inner Sanctum
This is the Sculptor’s personal hall, a place that resembles a cathedral merged with a laboratory. Floating shards of mirror reflect versions of the Sculptor from different realities. A broken Ascension pod lies in the corner, revealing his failed attempt to perfect himself.
#### Ascension Lab
A ritual chamber filled with polished marble and runes burning with infernal light. For those who choose to undergo the transformation, it offers transcendence, but also finality.
### Sidequests
#### echoes of the Ascended
One Ascended identifies a player character, revealing a past connection. The player must decide whether to attempt restoring their humanity or let them remain in their enhanced state.
#### _The Perfect Prison_
The Silver City may not be as open as it seems. When the players attempt to leave, they may be faced with philosophical or metaphysical barriers that test their commitment to autonomy.
#### _The Demon Seed_
A contained demon offers a deal to help the players destroy the Sculptor from within. Players must choose between trusting the enemy of their enemy or refusing to repeat past mistakes.

## Path of The Spire and Envied
### Location
They awaken in the Ashen valleys among the ruins of old [[Phalia]]. From here they can decide which direction to go to. No real solid goal (lots of improf here).

Path of envied contains some backstory information for [[Asher]]. Revealing the location of 1 or more allies depending on a persuasion check from [[Asher]]. Refer [[Asher Questline |here]]. But to make it simple
**Naib**: Nimbara
**The Twins**: Crescent Bay
**Kjara**: Alziria
