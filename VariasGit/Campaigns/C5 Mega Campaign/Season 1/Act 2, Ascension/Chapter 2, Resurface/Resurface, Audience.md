#### 1. The Offer of Purpose
> _“What will you do once you leave this place? Return to a world that let this happen? Or help me build one that never allows it again.”_
- Invite the party to lead: Not just foot soldiers, but _architects_ of the new age.
- He might offer them the chance to design one of the new Ascended "strains"—customized enhancements tailored to each of them.
- He makes it personal: “You’ve seen the horrors of Gehenna. Let it not be in vain.”

#### 2. Capture, Not Slaughter
> _“Why kill a demon, when you can convert it into a shield?”_
- Demons are to him what nuclear material is to a scientist: dangerous, volatile, but powerful when contained.
- He may ask the players to stop killing fiends—and instead help him capture them, using ritual crystals or soul-forges he gifts them.
- This presents a gameplay shift: instead of murder-hoboing demons, they must learn control, restraint, and tactical dominance.

#### 4. Autonomy vs. Liberation
> _“Freedom without power is a lie. I offer the world both.”_
- He challenges the concept of free will when it is _manipulated by hunger, oppression, or pain_.
- Makes the case that his Ascended are the first truly _free_ beings—no longer slaves to biology, fear, or greed.
- Asks the players: _“What did you do with your freedom that makes you think it’s so sacred?”_

#### 5. A Peaceful Future
> _“I can end Hell. Not fight it—_end_ it.”_
- If the players are worn down by the demon war, this point _hurts_. He promises an endgame.
- His proposal: spread his method far and wide, convert all of humanity into the Ascended. Demons no longer have fertile ground. War ends.
- This is the heart of his temptation: a _clean future_, paid for in monstrous sacrifice.

#### 6. He Knows Them
> _“Aeryth. You would burn a world for revenge. Artemis, you already tried to ‘cleanse’ the unworthy, and Asher—have you told them the truth?”_
- He sees into them. He uses their trials (Room of Fragmentation!) as conversational ammunition.
- This makes the encounter deeply _personal_.
- Optionally, he could offer to _reunite them_ with lost friends or family in Ascended form: “I could make them stronger. Better. Not dead.”

###  Dramatic Moment Options
- The Ascended player begins to see the City differently: whispers from the statue walls, strange memories, perhaps even fragments of personalities from those who died to create the city begin bleeding into them.
- A child's laughter echoes through the halls... followed by screams. The Sculptor ignores this.
- An Ascended recognizes one of the players: “You killed my village. But now... I am grateful.”
- An optional test: The Sculptor offers one of the players a trial—create your own Ascended using captured demon energy. Will they do it?

### Long-Term Seeds
- Perhaps the Sculptor is right—but incomplete. If the players defeat him, they are left with the ethical question: Do we now have to carry this work forward?
- Or perhaps he has already begun converting a major NPC or homeland city—and the party must choose to stop the transformation... or let it play out.


### Semi Scripts

"Youve come far. EFew walk out of Gehenna with their mind intact. Fewer still with their will, Ive been watching your journey for a while now, you suffered where others broke. You endured, that is rare. You must have questions, about this place, about me about what happens now?"

"I wont force anything upon you, ask or simply lsiten. Either path is fine."
