# Prior Knowledge
The party has fallen in battle—slain by Khaldrith’s Champion—and awakes not to death’s peace, but to **the endless rot and hunger of Gehenna’s First Layer: The Maw**.

**Yet they are not Lemures.**

Unlike the other damned, their forms remain intact—bruised, broken, but unmistakably themselves. A soft voice lingers at the edge of their minds, silk-wrapped and smiling: **Nyxarael**, the Serpent of Lust and Patron to one among them, has claimed their souls as hers. Whether out of favor, fondness, or as part of a deeper scheme, she has kept them whole. But her magic won’t last forever. Time—if it can be measured here—is running thin.
# Running this Chapter
This chapter begins with the players waking in the **Retching Fields**: a wide, sloping gulch where the land itself vomits up half-digested bodies, memories, and failed souls. **Carrion birds with human eyes** circle above. They must gather themselves, regroup, and survive long enough to understand where they are.

Their hunger gnaws at them constantly—**all sustenance here is cursed**, inducing hallucinations or more hunger. The world is **hostile**, yet **structured** just enough to hint at civilization… and perhaps, escape.

### Escape Routes
There will be multiple escape routes from gehenna they are listed here:
#### Path of the Ascended

Rumors of an outsider called _The Angel_ circulate in the more “civilized” hovels of Gehenna’s First Layer. Some say he comes to save. Others say he walks with monsters at his side.

When the party eventually finds him—injured or cornered—he speaks in riddles and doctrines. He requires help: harvesting **essence** from specific demons. In return, he promises a path out, one "forged not by escape, but by evolution." If questioned, he only says, “**Humanity must change to survive what Gehenna truly is.**”

His motives are **righteous but horrific**, tied to the villainous plans of **The Sculptor**.

#### The Retchspire Ritual

A monolithic tower of **hardened vomit, bone, and obsidian** rises in the deep wastes. The Retchspire is said to be a place where the Maw speaks directly, and where ancient rituals may open a temporary path to other planes—or deeper layers. To perform the ritual, the party must gather:

- **The blood of a soul consumed but unbroken**
- **Three tongues of hunger**, harvested from ravenous hunger-spirits
- **A fragment of identity**, found in the **Mirror Ruins**, a shattered temple that forces each PC to relive their worst regrets and cast away part of themselves

The ritual opens a portal—but to **what** or **where** is unpredictable.

#### Nyxarael’s Gambit 

Through **mirrors of blood**, **shattered reflections**, or even whispers behind the eyes of the warlocks she claims, **Nyxarael** reaches out. Her magic lingers like perfume that’s just a little too sweet. She preserved the party’s forms for a reason—not out of love, but because they are **useful**. Tools she intends to shape into something better.

She offers escape. A **path out of the Maw**, sealed behind a curse-bound gate somewhere in the **Cracked City of Alvakhaar**, a ruined noble district now overrun with aristocratic hunger-fiends.

But she will only unlock it if her champion (and their allies) perform a task:

> **Find a mortal soul—pure, principled, and untouched by the sin of Gehenna—and teach it to covet.**  
> Turn its admiration to **envy**, its selflessness to **ambition**. It must **choose** to betray another for power, status, or salvation.

This mortal might be:

- A faithful priest still preaching hope in a cratered chapel.
- A war orphan leading other survivors in mutual aid.
- An exiled demon who has turned pacifist and healer.

Nyxarael doesn’t want their death. She wants their **fall**—so she can take what was once pure, and twist it into **something that looks like her.**

If the players succeed, she opens the gate—but warns:

> _“This is not mercy. This is a gift you must one day return... with interest.”_

# Key Locations
#### The Glutton’s Sepulcher
The Maw’s heart—a fossilized, semi-living **god-corpse** where Khaldrith once embedded himself. The Sepulcher contains:
- **The Gorge Choir** – A room of ribcage arches and screaming mouths that echo every lie spoken within it.
- **The Butcher Gardens** – Massive slaughterfields where demon gourmands “harvest” souls for consumption.
- **The Deep Stomach** – A furnace-vault where cursed relics (like the Sword

#### The Cracked City of Alvakhaar
Once a prosperous city in the material world, Alvakhaar was dragged into Gehenna whole. Now a **crater-ridden ruin**, its opulent mansions and temples sit shattered and sunken in bile-flooded streets. The elite residents became **Hungerbound**—ghoulish nobles who host macabre feasts where they consume memories, dreams, and identities instead of food.

- **Feast-Guilds** here still compete for power in eternal banquets, each vying to "out-consume" the others.
- Whispers say a **sealed gate** (Nyxarael’s escape route) lies in the buried **Vault of the Jealous Moon**, guarded by a statue that only opens for those who know what it is to covet.

#### The Hollow Furnace
A subterranean complex of **digestive tunnels**, furnace-guts, and grinding bone-wheels, this is where **warped relics** and corrupted weapons are reforged. Maintained by **Devour-Smiths**, chained artisans who no longer eat or sleep but feed on the raw hate of broken items.

- [[Craven Claws]] can be found here, see the sidequests.
- Contains a **forge-spirit**, _Bel Kurez_, who was once corrupted by the claws and may test the bearer.

#### The Stomach Market
A bizarre black market run from inside a **massive, calcified beast**, half-lodged in a hill. The **merchants** are stitched-together horrors, but their wares are unmatched: vials of false hope, stolen memories, spices from dreams, and soul-silk.

- You pay in **secrets, envy, or pieces of your name**.
- One merchant, _Tallow_, is a former angel who fell through envy. His blood would be sufficient for the Retchspire Ritual.

#### The Retchspire
Mentioned previously, this **bone-and-bile spire** reaches like a claw to the skies. It's said to be a place where Gehenna “thinks” and “hungers.” It also houses the necessary site for the **Retchspire Ritual**—a dangerous escape method.

- Inside are **Hallucination Chambers**, where players must face a distorted vision of their greatest appetites or desires turned vile.

#### The Lantern Gut Library
> _“The dead forget. We help them remember. We sell what’s left.”_

Deep in a collapsed intestinal ravine lies an ancient archive, operated by the Gut Scribes—former philosophers, now long-necked husks wrapped in candlewax and scroll-skin. The Lantern-Gut Library houses knowledge etched on parchment grown from living stomach linings.
### Why the players will go:
- Ascension Lore: One of the scribes claims to have a full transcription of _The Sculptor’s Doctrine_—the original blueprints for Ascension itself.
- Forbidden Techniques: The library contains rituals for “devouring false selves,” which may let players shed a flaw, guilt, or even a level of exhaustion or corruption, at terrible metaphysical cost.
- Revelation of Timeline: One volume whispers how long Nyxarael’s magic will hold—down to the _approximate number of days, breaths, or choices_ remaining.

> Mechanic Hook: Each PC can ask one question of the library. The answer is always true—but costs a memory, spell slot, or a point of alignment drift toward a sin of their choice.


#### Choir of Tongues
> _“They sang the hunger into being. Now they only echo what you most regret saying.”_

Once an order of arch-heralds, the Choir of Tongues now forms a grotesque monument: a spine-bridge of living throats stretched across a chasm of bile. Their voices blend into a single, ever-changing chant.

Anyone who walks the bridge hears their own voice whispering back to them—every lie, half-truth, and moment of manipulation they’ve ever spoken.

### Why the players will go:
- Unlock a Vocal Ascended Trait (for Charisma-based PCs)
- Gain a new Word of Power (can be used once per day to override a spoken command, silence a spellcaster, or force a target to speak the truth)
- Crossing the bridge without falling into madness earns the blessing of True Hunger’s Echo — grants _+2 to Deception, Persuasion, and Intimidation_ for one week.

# Sidequests
#### The Craven Claws
A large beast deep within the first layer of [[Gehenna]] holds this weapon. This beast was once a man, but wielding these blades changed him into a monster, only able to satiate its hunger.
More info [[Craven Claws |here]]

#### The Mourning Maw
> In a crater near the Obese Peaks, a pit weeps continuously, whispering apologies. It’s said to be the grave of **Khaldrith’s original form**, devoured by his own ascension.

- Ritualists believe if one feeds the Mourning Maw with something truly loved, it grants a **boon of immunity** to hunger.
- But beware: **the Maw remembers what it eats**, and it may call it back.

#### [[The Feast of False Saints]]
> A horde of demonic zealots is preparing a massive sacrificial feast to summon an Avatar of Khaldrith. They’ve kidnapped dozens of **non-damned mortals**, including the soul Nyxarael wants corrupted.

- Stopping the feast saves the captives—but lets Khaldrith’s corruption grow elsewhere.
- Joining the feast could let the players infiltrate the cult and steal a **gem-heart** used to stabilize portals.

#### The Parasite Moon
> A pale orb floats above part of the wastes. Locals say it’s the remains of a **demon prince** who tried to consume Gehenna itself. The light from the moon causes **extreme emotional hunger**—envy, lust, rage—depending on the viewer.

- If the players ascend to it via a crumbling spire, they may find an **ancient glutton-mind** sealed inside, willing to offer knowledge in exchange for feeding on one PC’s **envy**.
