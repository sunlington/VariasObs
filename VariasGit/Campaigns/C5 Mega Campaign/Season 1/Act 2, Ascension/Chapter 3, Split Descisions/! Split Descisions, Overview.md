# Running this Chapter
This chapter is very long, and contains many winding paths. It starts in [[The Silver City]] in [[Feronia]]

### The Volunteers
After leaving [[The Silver City]], they travel for some time, Encountering some demons along the way. They move through the war-torn valleys of [[Feronia]] eventually reaching a refugee village, [[Tordan]]. This village has been under attack by demons and to defend the city their guard captain and some guards are planning to undergo the ascension process.
Some of them are volunteering out of fear or social pressure not because they want to.
If the players do not stop the ascensions, one of the rituals fails creating a tainted form, the volunteers unwillingness broke the bounds of the ritual causing a dysfunction. The players must defeat it, afterwards [[Sculptor]] says it is a "Statistical Anomaly"

see the monster they fight here: [[The Beast of Tordan]]

### The Lost Lance


### Invading Antaria
The Sculptor asks the players for assistance. His forces are spread thin as they are fighting off demons in [[Alziria]] and [[Gehenna]] alike. Some demons have infiltrated the walls of Antaria and they require help. He also gives them some capturing tools saying:
"Some of the population may need to be detained, as their blood has been tainted. Bring them to me so I can cure them." 
"Some of them might have to be culled, however"
"Would you keep a dying limb to save a trembling hand?"

This missions will be quite expansive, including the following aspects:
- Infiltrate Antaria and pass their high walls
- Travel to the City
	- Includes hints for the existence of the [[Cohors Mechanica]]
- Save the City while capturing tainted civilians
- Sneak out of the City while transporting the captured civilians.
