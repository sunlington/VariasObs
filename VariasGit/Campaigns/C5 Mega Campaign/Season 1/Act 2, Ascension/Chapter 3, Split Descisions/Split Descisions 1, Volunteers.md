# Arrival in [[Tordan]]
- The players come upon a war-ravaged village built within the ruins of an older town. Ramshackle homes, broken stone walls, and signs of frequent demon attacks are everywhere.
- A funeral pyre smolders just outside the gates. Smoke hangs low in the air.
- Villagers give the players suspicious but hopeful looks. Some recognize them as mercenaries or heroes; others whisper rumors about outsiders disrupting the “blessing” of The Sculptor.

- The village is clearly suffering. Supplies are low, families are huddled together in communal shelters, and the land shows signs of corruption.
- A few wooden masks, smooth and white, are sold as “protection charms” – modeled after The Sculptor’s face.

## Key NPCs
- **Captain Lenra Voss**: Hardened and practical, she has agreed to the Ascension trials out of desperation. She believes it's the only way to protect the village.
- **Sister Maeli**: A local priestess vehemently opposed to The Sculptor's methods. She believes his rituals are abominable and will doom the soul.
- **Jarik**: A young farmer and one of the volunteers. He’s terrified but feels obligated to protect his younger siblings.
- **Keris**: One of the successfully Ascended. Their skin is white and cracked like marble, but they speak with calm, articulate purpose. They view their new form as a gift and a liberation.

## Events
The first night of the player's stay there is a demon attack on the village which they must defend. While most of the guards are dealing with the demons they must avoid demon attacks while rescueing villagers from their homes and bringing them to safety.

**Melees**: Worg Statblock with 2d6 fire on bit, and death burst (10ft radius dex 14 or take 2d6 fire)
**ranged**: Cult Fanatic statblock with fire bolt (2d10) Hellish rebuke(1s) Shriek Pulse (15 ft cone, dc13 wis or frightened 1 until end of next turn.)

This fight will cause some loses in villagers and sparks the "Ascension debate" this debate is sparked when the party is being commended by **Captain Lenra** and **Sister Maeli** storms in telling them to stop the ascension.
But the captain insists, only if all ascendants do so voluntarily, as the [[Sculptor]] insists.
# The Coming Ritual
- Ritual grounds are set up in the town square: an altar engraved with runes and sigils drawn from a mix of demonic and scientific origins. Blood channels are cleaned and re-etched by followers of The Sculptor.
- The atmosphere is a mix of reverence and dread. People fear the ascensions, but feel like they need it to survive.
- An envoy from The Sculptor arrives to conduct the ceremony. Their role is purely ritualistic—cold, efficient, and unflinching. They quote The Sculptor often, saying things like:
    - “To become more, one must be undone.”
    - “From ash rises the perfected flame.”
- The envoy insists that statistics show a success rate above 8%, which is “a marvel of precision, given the scale.”

- Debates flare among townsfolk. Some families beg their relatives not to go through with it. Others urge compliance to protect the village.
- A secretly coerced volunteer may ask the players for help, flee, sabotage, or replace them.
- Several volunteers are kept in trance-like preparation, fasting and meditating under supervision.
- Players can engage in personal roleplay with NPCs, offer last words to volunteers, or investigate the ritual site more deeply.
- Omens, nightmares, or psychic disturbances may hint that something will go wrong.

(Try to time session end as the ritual goes wrong)

# Ritual Failure
- Three volunteers step forward: Jarik, the coerced mother, and one confident town guard.
- As the chanting begins, blood is poured into the runes. The sky darkens unnaturally, and a low hum reverberates through the village.

- One of the volunteers mentally resists. The ritual destabilizes, rupturing the altar and releasing dark energy.
- The result: a horrific malformed creature rises, [[The Beast of Tordan]] twisted and incomplete.
- The creature retains fragments of the volunteer's voice, crying out in pain, confusion, and horror
- The creature is fast, erratic, and disturbingly intelligent.
- Mid-fight, it might shout lines like:
    - “I didn’t want this—why didn’t you stop it?”
    - “Make it stop burning—make me whole again...”
- The Ascended Keris may intervene to protect villagers or try to reason with the Beast, further complicating the fight.
- Hitting the creature results in small fire-y/radiant explosions. This results in the players having to be careful during the fight to avoid collateral damage with villagers, while also taking down the beast swiftly.

- The Sculptor’s envoy dismisses the failure as “a statistical anomaly.”
- The other two Ascended are welcomed with solemn celebration.
- Sister Maeli and other dissenters become more vocal, begging the players to intervene before more deaths occur.
- Villagers begin to choose sides, further dividing the community.

**Keris**, respecting the player's might asks for their assistance in a matter of great importance. While he himself is not allowed to deal with it, due to his duty to [[The Silver City]], he asks the players to go to [[Antaria]] for [[Split Descisions 3, Invasion]].


### Extra Session notes
Describe ritualistic sigils and runes in both the catacombs and ritual chamber in a similar manner.
