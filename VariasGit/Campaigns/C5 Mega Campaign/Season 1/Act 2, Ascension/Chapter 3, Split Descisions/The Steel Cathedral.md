_“The heart still beats. The steel still prays.”_

**Tone:** reverence, unease, awakening.  
**Mood palette:** clanking echoes, faint hymns sung by broken vox systems, steam misting from vents like breath, faint glows pulsing to a rhythm like a heartbeat.

### **Entrance — The Shattered Descent**

The party tumbles into a **cathedral of rust**: a vast vertical shaft lined with gantries, chains, and machine altars. A great statue lies shattered at the base — a **Warforged saint** cradling a molten sword.

- **Environmental note:** The air hums with faint static — the **Warforged PC feels it resonate** in his chest, like a muscle memory.
- **Arcana / Insight:** The metal here “remembers” — residual energy from soulforging rites, binding consciousness to steel.
- **Optional flash-memory:** The PC hears ghostly orders echo through his mind: “Legion Mortalis kneel before command.”

> Barcus whispers: “This place was meant to birth gods in armor.”

### **Area I — The Hall of Forging Hymns**

Once a factory-floor temple where Warforged were made, blessed, and “breathed” to life.

- **Visuals:** Rows of **cruciform frames** still hold half-finished Warforged — some fused into the walls, others slumped, hollow-eyed.
- The walls are inscribed with prayers:
    > “Through Iron, Eternity. Through Command, Purpose. Through Purpose, Peace.”
    
- A low, rhythmic sound repeats — a **chanting machine** still trying to complete its activation ritual, endlessly looping.

**For the Warforged PC:**  
When he steps near an unfinished body, its head turns to him with a faint creak and whispers in a voice like his own:

> “You left us incomplete, Commander.”

These are **imprints**, not undead — but the guilt, the recognition, and the strange AI-like “faith” they exhibit deepen the dread.

**Discovery:**  
A **forgemaster’s key** — a hexagonal gear that hums faintly when held by the Warforged. It can open sealed doors deeper in.

### **Area II — The Memory Crucible**

A smaller, domed chamber with a **crucible of glowing metal** in its center.  
Racks of ritual tools and cracked crystal jars surround it.

- When approached, the crucible flares to life — showing **visions of the Warforged’s past**: the legion burning cities, his own commands echoed by a dozen mechanical voices.
- Then, abruptly, the vision _changes_ — the same legion, but _with new marks_, new sigils pulsing where his once stood.
    - This foreshadows that something is **reawakening the old legions**, possibly corrupted by demonic will.

**Skill challenge:** If the PC attempts to interact with the memory, he can make Arcana / Wisdom saves to resist being “reformatted” — the system tries to re-bind him to command protocol.

**Outcome possibilities:**

- Success: He gains insight — he recalls **old command codes**, which can help disable or control lesser Warforged later in the campaign.
- Failure: He temporarily loses agency (one round of confusion), speaking in an ancient military chant before recovering — giving everyone a scare.

### **Area III — The Reliquary of Silence**

A long, narrow hall with hundreds of **severed Warforged heads**, each embedded in alcoves, connected by thin silver tubes.  
They murmur in unison when approached.

> “We served. We broke. We rust. You still walk.”

Each head acts as a data reliquary — together they form a primitive network mind, a proto-AI of the old legions.

**Purpose:**  
They can answer one or two cryptic questions — but speaking with them drains their remaining power, causing lights to fade like dying candles.

**Treasure / Reward:**

- **Memory Core Fragment** – a smooth, palm-sized sphere that can store a spell or memory. The Warforged can use it later to record or replay memories — or even offload traumatic ones.

---

### **Area IV — The Heart of Siez-Theta**

At the core lies the **Heart Engine** — a colossal machine that once gave soul to the Warforged. It still pulses faintly, half-melted, cables hanging like entrails.

- The hum of it sets the Warforged PC’s core to vibrate. He hears its voice, faint and parental:
    > “You were made to serve. Why do you deny your perfection?”
- The others hear only static and low thudding metal.

**Choice moment:**

- The PC can commune with the Heart, learning that the “soulforging” process required fragments of living souls — bound and twisted to obey command.
- The Heart offers him “reconnection” — to remove pain, guilt, and loneliness — at the cost of individuality.
- Rejecting it may overload the Heart, causing the structure to begin collapsing (their escape sequence).
- Accepting it even briefly could grant a **permanent mark** — a glowing sigil of Siez-Theta that responds to nearby Warforged tech later in the campaign.

---

### **Exit — The Shattered Ascent**

The party escapes, through old steam vents as the foundry collapses into itself, steam venting like dying breath.  
As they emerge onto the mountain slope again, the Warforged’s body still hums faintly.  
In the distance, faint _forgehymns_ echo through the wind — impossibly far, yet clear.

---

### **Optional Additions & Hooks**

- **Ambient horror:** The foundry’s lights flicker in sync with the Warforged’s heartbeat.
- **Lore reward:** They can recover schematics, old code runes, or soulforging fragments — useful for tracking or sabotaging active foundries later.
- **Emotional resonance:** The dungeon should feel like a _pilgrimage into the PC’s past sins_, not just an exploration site.
