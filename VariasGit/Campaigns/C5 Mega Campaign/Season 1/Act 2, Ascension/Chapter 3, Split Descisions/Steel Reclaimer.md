# **CORE MECHANICS**

The Steel Reclaimer is designed to **move**, **suppress**, **zone**, and **shape the battlefield**, preventing “stand still and trade damage” play.

### **Overheating Gauge**

When the boss uses a flamethrower or takes more than 40 damage in a round, it gains a heat point.  
At **3 heat**, the Reclaimer enters **Overheat Mode**:

- Gains advantage on attack rolls
    
- Gains +10 movement
    
- Vulnerable to cold damage
    
- Flamethrower deals +2d8 fire
    

Lasts **2 rounds**, then vents steam in a 30-ft cone (no damage, but knocks prone, DC 17 Dex).

---

# **ACTIONS**

### **Multiattack**

The Reclaimer makes two attacks:

### **Minigun Burst** (Ranged Weapon Attack, +9 hit, 100 ft)

Hit: 18 (4d8) piercing.  
On a crit: the target must make a DC 16 Str save or be knocked prone from impact.

### **Crushing Servo-Fist** (Melee, +10 hit, reach 10 ft)

Hit: 17 (2d10 + 6) bludgeoning.  
If target is wearing metal armor, it deals an extra 2d8 damage.

### **Hellfurnace Spray (Recharge 5–6)**

30-ft cone, Dex save DC 18.  
Fail: 36 (8d8) fire  
Success: half.  
Creatures failing the save take 1d8 fire at the end of their next turn (residual ignition).

---

# **LEGENDARY ACTIONS (3 per round)**

### **Repositioning Stride (Cost 1)**

Moves up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

### **Suppressing Fire (Cost 2)**

Targets one creature. Attack with the minigun at disadvantage.  
Hit: half damage (9 piercing), but target must make DC 16 Wis save or have disadvantage on attacks until the end of its next turn (keeps their head down).

### **Magnetic Pulse (Cost 3)**

DC 17 Str save for all creatures within 20 ft.  
Fail: pulled 10 ft toward the boss and take 10 lightning damage.  
Metal-wearing creatures have disadvantage.

---

# **TELEGRAPHED ATTACK SYSTEM**

At the **end of each of its turns**, the Reclaimer chooses one telegraph to initiate.  
At the **start** of its next turn, the effect resolves.

Telegraphs should be **very visible**, giving players a chance to avoid them.

---

# **TELEGRAPHED ATTACKS**

---

## **1. Rotating Cannon Sweep**

**Telegraph:**  
The minigun begins spinning rapidly and the Reclaimer plants its feet, lowering its center of mass.  
It tracks several targets in an arc.

**Resolution (next turn):**  
The Reclaimer fires a giant sweeping burst in a **180-degree arc** (60-ft range).  
All creatures in the arc must make a DC 17 Dex save or take 24 (6d8) piercing.  
Creatures that moved at least 15 ft away from the boss since last turn automatically succeed.

**Intended player behavior:**  
Move to the safe half of the room.

---

## **2. Furnace Overload**

**Telegraph:**  
Steam vents on its shoulders glow brighter and molten liquid drips from the exhaust grates.

**Resolution (next turn):**  
The ground within **15 ft** begins glowing and superheats.  
Creatures standing there must move out or take:

- 18 (4d8) fire
    
- And have their movement halved as their boots/metal heats
    

Standing still = punished.

---

## **3. Hydraulic Stampede**

**Telegraph:**  
The machine crouches low, pistons compressing audibly.  
Its eyes narrow and lock onto a straight lane.

**Resolution (next turn):**  
The Reclaimer charges **in a 60-ft straight line**, trampling everything.  
Creatures must succeed a DC 17 Dex save or take 22 (4d10) bludgeoning and be knocked prone.

If it hits a wall or obstacle, debris scatters (half damage to all within 10 ft).

**Intended player behavior:**  
Get out of the path.

---

## **4. Magnetic Lock-On**

**Telegraph:**  
Panels open on its chest, revealing rotating magnetic coils.  
Loose metal shakes toward the boss.

**Resolution (next turn):**  
One target wearing metal armor or holding a metal weapon must make a DC 17 Str save or be **yanked** 20 ft and restrained at the boss’s feet.

Players can prevent this by:

- Dropping metal gear
    
- Hiding behind cover
    
- Breaking line of sight
    

---

## **5. Shrapnel Cyclone**

**Telegraph:**  
The Reclaimer tears chunks of metal from the environment and pulls them into a swirling orb around itself.

**Resolution (next turn):**  
A 20-ft radius around the boss becomes a shredding hazard:

- Creatures entering or starting turn there take 3d8 slashing
    
- Difficult terrain
    
- Projectile attacks have disadvantage
    

Can be avoided by simply **backing away**.

---

# **ENVIRONMENTAL INTERACTIONS (optional but recommended)**

### **Chain Cranes**

Players can drop heavy chains on the Reclaimer with a DC 15 attack or check to deal 3d10 bludgeoning and restrain it for 1 round.

### **Cooling Pipes**

Cold damage sources burst a pipe (once per pipe), creating a 15-ft radius cold zone giving advantage against Overheat damage.

### **Molten Channels**

Small rivers of molten metal the boss can push players into or the flamethrower can ignite.

### **Control Consoles**

A player can attempt a DC 17 Arcana check to temporarily scramble the Reclaimer, giving them one free round where its AC drops by 2 and it loses legendary actions.

---

# **PHASE 2 (AT 120 HP)**

The Reclaimer sheds armor plating and becomes **faster and more aggressive**.

- Speed increases to 50 ft
    
- Gains +2 to attack rolls
    
- Overheat triggers at 2 heat instead of 3
    
- Telegraphs occur **every round automatically**, no limit
    

New reaction:

### **Molten Backlash**

When hit with melee, sprays sparks.  
Creature must make DC 15 Dex save or take 2d6 fire.

This phase should feel more chaotic, with the room filling with hazards, metal debris, overheat vents, and charges.

# **OPTIONAL CONNECTIONS TO YOUR STORY**

### **For the Warforged PC**

- The machine may identify him as “Commander-class unit”
    
- Might target him more aggressively
    
- During the fight, broken audio logs may glitch out old battle orders
    

### **For the Nyx-pact PC**

- They may sense faint, almost subliminal “whispers” in the magnetic telegraphs
    
- Not enough to reveal anything, just enough to unsettle
