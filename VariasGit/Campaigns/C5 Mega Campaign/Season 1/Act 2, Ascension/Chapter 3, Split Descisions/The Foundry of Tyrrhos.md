### A Nonlinear, 32-Room Dungeon of Industrial and Subtle Fiendish Influence

## **Overview**

This foundry is not the mastermind’s lair.  
It is **only one node** in a larger network of revitalized Cohors Mechanica factories.  
The atmosphere should feel:

- Industrial revolution inspired
    
- Half-functional, half-haunted machine cathedral
    
- Whispers of corrupted power, but nothing overt
    
- Familiar and painful to the warforged PC
    
- Unsettlingly familiar to the Nyx-pact PC, but not explicit
    

The foundry’s purpose is simple:  
**Restart warforged production.  
Quietly. Efficiently. Without drawing attention.**

---

# **LAYOUT**

The structure remains three major layers with loops, branching paths, shortcuts, and dead ends.

### **LAYER A — SURFACE COMPLEX (Rooms 1–10)**

### **LAYER B — THE MECHANIZED FORGE-WORKS (Rooms 11–20)**

### **LAYER C — THE DEEP ENGINE (Rooms 21–32)**

Everything below has been rewritten to remove the “original builder” element and replace it with something far more mysterious and distant.

---

# **ZONE 1: THE BROKEN EXTERIOR (Rooms 1–7)**

Rust-eaten scaffolds, inactive cranes, collapsed entrances.  
This zone teaches the logic of the dungeon: broken machines require clever solutions.

---

### **1. Cracked Gatehouse**

Door is jammed — requires Strength or tinkering checks.  
Inside: old Cohors sigils burned off the walls.  
A warforged PC gets a flicker: **he once marched through a similar gate at the head of Legio Mortalis.**

---

### **2. Collapsed Yard**

###### **Room Description**

A large, open yard choked with twisted beams, slag boulders, and collapsed gantries.  
Ahead, three giant **industrial debris-shifters** (towering metal pistons with claws) protrude from the ground, each connected to a thick chain that leads to a rusted control panel.

Three levers sit on the panel, each marked only with a faded Cohors Mechanica rune.

A safe ledge wraps around the east wall. On that ledge, the PCs can observe how the debris moves when a lever is thrown.
See notebook.

If the players are on the debris when it moves, call for a Dex save to avoid falling.
---

### **3. Dead Crane Control Loft**

Two consoles spark weakly.  
If repaired (Arcana + tinkering), they can:

- Move the crane arm (opening new paths on the surface)
    
- Drop a crate on enemies in Room 6
    
- Reveal a hidden ladder to Room 12
    

---

### **4. Fossilized War Machine**

Half-buried giant warforged shell (nonfunctioning).  
Touching its helm gives the warforged PC a **flashback of commanding a battalion**, their metallic voices chanting his designation.

---

### **5. The Conveyor Gorge**

A deep gorge once used for moving ore.  
To cross:

- Fix the conveyor (Arcana)
    
- Use grappling hooks
    
- Or fight a flock of **rust-eaters** that nest inside the pit.
    

---

### **6. Guardian Turret Nest**

Two automated turrets reactivate mid-exploration.  
They use predictable patterns — players can hide behind moving crane arms from Room 3.

---

### **7. The Service Stairwell**

A spiraling descent, cracked and unstable.  
As they descend, purple fumes leak from a pipe, triggering low whispering hallucinations.  
The Nyx-bound PC may understand fragments.

Leads into Zone 2.

---

# **ZONE 2: THE LOWER FACTORY SPINE (Rooms 8–15)**

The industrial heart where materials once flowed.  
Hot, loud, dangerous — but many machines are only partially functional.

---

### **8. Control Mesh Junction**

A grid of catwalks above a chasm full of moving gears.  
Some walkways shift unexpectedly every 30 seconds.  
Falling = shredded.

---

### **9. Material Sorting Hub**

Three chutes labeled (in ancient Cohors script):

- Flesh
    
- Metal
    
- Stone
    

Any metal object dropped into a chute disappears somewhere deeper.  
If _a PC_ jumps in, they slide into Room 19.

---

### **10. Hammerline Corridor**

Gigantic forging hammers slam down at intervals.  
Players must navigate timing puzzle.  
A failed check doesn’t kill — but knocks the PC into a lower bay (Room 14).

---

### **11. The Split Lift Shaft**

A broken industrial elevator hangs by one chain.

**Puzzle:**  
Players must redistribute weight (jumping, holding chains, adjusting levers) to swing it into position.

Going up = secret balcony (Room 15).  
Going down = Rooms 13 or 14.

---

### **12. The Dead Fabricator Shrine**

A room lined with statues of Cohors engineers.  
A plug of melted metal blocks the floor hatch.

If melted/removed, reveals **serpent-like patterns** underneath that weren’t part of Cohors design.

---

### **13. Loader Drone Pen**

Three loader drones sit inert — until someone touches the center pillar.  
They animate with jerky, unstable movements.  
A fight, but drones are glitchy and sometimes attack each other.

---

### **14. The Scrap Avalanche Room**

Every few minutes, scrap metal falls from a chute above.  
Noise makes stealth impossible.  
Treasure buried under a pile, but digging risks more avalanches.

---

### **15. High Monitoring Balcony**

A vantage view of the entire lower spine.  
Here, the warforged PC sees another flashback:  
**Legio Mortalis marching single-file beneath him, obeying his commands precisely.**

---

# **ZONE 3: THE ARCANE FORGE COMPLEX (Rooms 16–23)**

The magical heart powering construction.  
Purple smoke occasionally wafts through cracks.  
Serpentine motifs appear subtly (curved pipes, coiling wires).

---

### **16. Arcane Relay Chamber**

Floating runestones orbit a central crystal.  
Crystal hums with faint purple mist.  
Touching it shows visions of metal twisting into serpentine shapes.

Arcana puzzle: align the runestones to open Rooms 17 and 18.

---

### **17. Tempering Baths**

Pools of glowing metal.  
Stepping into steam clouds triggers psychic images for the warforged PC of past atrocities — burning villages, forced conversions, his legion following him without hesitation.

---

### **18. Rune-Carver Hall**

Pillars etched with ancient Cohors runes, but every rune has been delicately altered with small **serpentine accents**.  
Identifying the difference reveals a hidden corridor to Room 20.

---

### **19. The Sorting Pit**

Anyone who fell through chute in Room 9 arrives here.  
They must avoid conveyor belts that dump into crushing machines.

Skill challenge with moving hazards.

---

### **20. The Forgemaster’s Mirror**

A giant polished metal mirror once used to check warforged alignment and integrity.  
If the warforged PC approaches, the mirror shows him as he once appeared:  
Black metal, eyes like burning coals, rank insignia of **Legio Mortalis**.

Touching it causes a hostile **echo** (a shadow-duplicate of him) to emerge and fight.

---

### **21. The Coolant Rupture**

Frozen mists leak from broken pipes.  
Pipes periodically burst, creating zones of extreme cold.  
Players can redirect the flow with valves to freeze moving enemies or hazards.

---

### **22. Arcane Furnace Heart**

A sphere of metal the size of a wagon pulses with violet light.

Stabilizing it (hard Arcana) prevents periodic ground-quakes in later rooms.  
If ignored, later rooms have hazards.

---

### **23. The Ingenuum Core Lift**

A huge elevator platform with four separate crank stations.  
Players must coordinate cranks to lift platform evenly.  
If uneven: the platform tilts and slides them into side rooms (Rooms 24 or 25).

---

# **ZONE 4: THE BROKEN AI CHAMBERS (Rooms 24–30)**

Where the Foundry’s guiding intelligences once worked.  
Now corrupted, confused, and partially rewired by something new.

---

### **24. Memory Archive Vault**

Walls of crystal plates store ancient war logs.  
Touching them reveals garbled memories — including glimpses of Nyx, disguised as a woman of smoke whispering into the Foundry’s original Architect.

---

### **25. Overseer Maintenance Den**

A spider-like repair construct scuttles around.  
It’s not hostile unless attacked.  
It can repair minor PC injuries or unlock nearby doors.

---

### **26. The Paradox Chamber**

A logic puzzle room: three doors labeled incorrectly.  
Solving the paradox opens the correct door (to Room 28).  
Incorrect answers release a harmless burst of purple mist that shows illusions of warforged marching.

---

### **27. Labyrinth of Whispering Pipes**

Small, maze-like hall of pipes carrying faint whispers.  
The Nyx-bound PC can make out subtle words, but never clear meaning.  
Metal serpents coil embossed into some pipe sections.

---

### **28. Custodian Lair**

Two elite warforged guardians awaken.  
They fight defensively; clearly following some old logic.  
Near their pedestal is a repair manual that can disable a turret in Room 29.

---

### **29. The Hall of Dissonant Orders**

A speaker system glitches constantly, issuing conflicting army commands.  
Players making wrong moves (dash, attack, or cast spells depending on command) cause the room to shock them.  
Following none of the orders avoids damage.

---

### **30. The War Map Cortex**

A massive tactical hologram table flickers.  
It occasionally shows maps of **modern Feronia**, not the old war.

Someone is updating it.

The room also contains clues pointing deeper toward the Foundry Core.

---

# **ZONE 5: THE DEEP FORGE AND ARENA (Rooms 31–35)**

The final descent.  
Machines run at partial power; green and purple glow reflects off metal walls.

---

### **31. The Resonance Bridge**

A narrow metal bridge over a chasm of humming energy.  
Stepping on runes causes harmonics that push or pull PCs.  
Crossing requires timing the pulses or disabling the resonance nodes.

---

### **32. Serpent Coil Breach**

A pipe breach sprays violet smoke forming a faint serpentine silhouette for a moment.  
Inside the pipe: a warforged partially twisted into strange shapes — not alive, not dead.

A subtle hint of Nyx’s influence, nothing more.

---

### **33. The Assembly Chamber**

Three partially built warforged assemble themselves badly, limbs reversed, heads upside down.  
They attack with unstable patterns.  
The warforged PC might recognize them as **failed prototypes** of his legion.

---

### **34. Reactor Catwalks**

Steam blasts, rotating platforms, arcs of lightning.  
Environmental hazard skill challenge while fighting small constructs.

A failed jump drops someone into a maintenance tunnel (loop back to Room 31).

---

### **35. The Great Foundry Core — Boss Area**

[[Steel Reclaimer]]
