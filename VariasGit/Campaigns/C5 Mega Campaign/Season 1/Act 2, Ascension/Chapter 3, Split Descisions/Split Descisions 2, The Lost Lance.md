### Background


### Who is Barcus?
[[Barcus Taldoran]] was once a member of the proud [[Lances of Siez]], however, after the betrayal of [[Fausto Emirez]]; he left. He went back to his homeland: [[Feronia]] to protect it against [[Fausto Emirez]] and his thirst for power. He is an incredible technician and master of guerilla tactics. Due to his past in the war he now holds a strong hatred towards the [[Cohors Mechanica]] and all associated with them. However he holds no hatred towards the [[Antaria |Antarians]] as they were only pawns in [[Fausto Emirez |Fausto's]] games. 


### The Meeting
**Setting:**  
A dimly lit war-room in the capital of **Raetzal**, filled with blueprints, scavenged warforged parts, and maps pinned with blood-red markers. The air smells faintly of oil and incense. Barcus stands near a massive table covered in plans , a mix of mechanical schematics and guerrilla strategy maps.

**Mood:**  
Wary, tense. Barcus is not a diplomat , he’s a soldier haunted by the past, trying to stop it from happening again.


In the meeting in the capital of [[Feronia]]: [[Raetzal]], [[Barcus Taldoran]] will first confront the players due to their ownership of several old [[Cohors Mechanica]] warforged. While also being suprised and perhaps somewhat hostile towards [[Artemis]] due to him being the same type of warforged. However he does notice artemis has much more sentience the normal warforged, and the same moral compass as himself. 

He continues past this, he noticed the dragon horde and queries about where its owner is. Learning that the players have slain it, he will ask them to assist in upcoming troubles. He suspects a war is brewing, people are getting desperate due to the demon attacks, some turning to the ascension of [[The Sculptor]]. In his travels he noticed that the [[Cohors Mechanica]] is returning, the once abandoned factories are back in the works. Barcus thinks it to be vital to shut these processed down before they get out of hand, and to prevent a war.

Some dialogue for ideas, tone and paraphrasing:

**Barcus:**  
_(without looking up)_  
You came. Good.  
Saves me the trouble of hunting you down.

_(He nudges a charred metal arm across the table.)_  
Recognize this?  
I found half a dozen of them — wandering around your fine new estate.  
Cohors make. Every bolt, every rune.

_(Looks up now, coldly)_  
You want to tell me why you’re rebuilding the same machines that bled my homeland dry?

---

_(Pause for player reaction — let them justify or protest. If they claim the warforged were harmless servants…)_

**Barcus (snarls):**  
Harmless? That’s what they called them before the Siege of Cevile.  
They said _"They’ll only dig trenches, carry supplies."_  
Then the orders changed — and they dug graves instead.

---

_(He exhales, forcing himself calmer.)_  
You don’t leave a fuse burning once you’ve seen the explosion.  
So yes — I tore them apart.  
And if you’ve got more stashed away, I’ll do it again.

_(leans in)_  
But I didn’t call you here to trade threats.  
I called you here because I needed to see what kind of fools you are.  
The blind kind… or the kind who might actually listen.

---

_(His gaze shifts to Artemis, eyes narrowing.)_

**Barcus:**  
And you.  
You’re one of them — Cohors build, through and through.  
_(hand drifts to weapon, then stops)_  
But you… you _look_ at me. The old ones never did that.

_(a long pause)_  
Tell me, warforged — do you follow orders? Or do you follow _choice_?

---

_(Let Artemis respond. If he shows humanity or remorse, Barcus softens slightly.)_

**Barcus (quietly):**  
Then maybe not all iron hearts are hollow.  
Maybe.

---

_(He reaches beneath the table, pulls out a rolled parchment, and slaps it down — a map showing the northern territories, marked with circles of ink.)_

**Barcus:**  
These are what’s left of the Cohors foundries.  
Abandoned since the war. Dead ruins. Or so we thought.

_(He slides another scrap forward — a scout’s sketch of a distant forge belching smoke.)_  
Now they’re stirring again.  
New shipments, old banners. Someone’s re-lighting the furnaces.

_(grimly)_  
I don’t know who. I don’t know why.  
But I’ve seen the trails — and I can feel it in my bones.  
It’s starting again.

---

_(He straightens, looking each of them in the eye.)_

**Barcus:**  
I don’t trust you. Not yet.  
But if you didn’t mean harm — if you didn’t build those things to march —  
then prove it.

Help me shut these forges down.  
Before Feronia burns again.

## The Travels
##### Route 1: **Through Talos Pass — The Diplomatic Path**

_Theme: Tension under watchful eyes. The calm before the storm._

**Goal:** Secure passage through Antarian territory by negotiation or discretion, amid growing paranoia about demons and deserters.

---

###### **Encounter 1: The Checkpoint at Falos’ Gate**

A fortified border-town built into the cliffs. The Antarian military is stretched thin fighting demon incursions; soldiers are tired, jumpy, and suspicious of spies.

- **Captain Vareen** questions their reason for travel. She’s wary of Feronians but desperate for capable allies.
    
- If Artemis is with them, his warforged nature draws curiosity — “Never seen one like him. Old Feronian tech?” — but no hostility _yet_.
    
- A Persuasion or Deception challenge can win safe passage; offering to help fend off demons or deliver supplies earns goodwill.
    
- Barcus hides his hatred well, but the sight of Antarian armor visibly tightens his jaw.
    

---

###### **Encounter 2: The Demon Rift**

Deep in the pass, a shimmering tear opens above a ruined shrine. **Imps and lesser demons** swarm a convoy of refugees.

- The party can intervene, gaining the respect of local troops and civilians.
    
- During or after the fight, strange metallic **runes pulse faintly** on the shrine stones — _old Cohors Mechanica script_, though none of the locals recognize it.
    
- Barcus grows uneasy but says little. The players might catch him tracing the rune’s shape with his thumb.
    

---

###### **Encounter 3: Rumors in the Pass**

At a mountain inn, the players overhear merchants and soldiers sharing rumors:

> “Old foundries in the plains burning at night…”  
> “Black smoke that smells of ozone and oil…”  
> “No demons there, though — they stay away.”  
> None of them truly understand the implications — it’s treated like superstition.  
> This is your slow foreshadowing that _something other than demons_ is stirring.

---

###### **Encounter 4: Falos’ End**

Near the exit, the party encounters a **collapsed tunnel** and stranded Antarian engineers. They beg for help clearing it before demons breach it from the other side.

- The party can assist (skill challenge: Strength, Arcana, Survival).
    
- During the work, they uncover **strange golden residue** fused into the rock — Barcus recognizes it as traces of _Arcanite smelting_.
    
- He says quietly:
    
    > “This isn’t demon work. Someone’s been reforging.”  
    > The first concrete sign that his fears were right.
    

---

#####  Route 2: **Through the Aleat Mountains — The Covert Path**

_Theme: Isolation, paranoia, discovery._

**Goal:** Sneak through the treacherous mountains and reach the Antarian plains unseen.

---

###### **Encounter 1: The Forgotten Tunnels**

Old Feronian supply tunnels from the war — half-collapsed and long unused.

- The walls bear marks of old battles: scorch stains, abandoned gear, bones half-turned to dust.
- They find an **ancient Arcanite crate**, its contents melted into slag but still faintly warm to the touch.
- Barcus recognizes the crest of the _Lances of Siez_.
    > “We stored our soulforging metal here once… Whoever came after took what was left.”

---

###### **Encounter 2: The Iron Echoes**

At night, faint metallic footsteps echo through the tunnels — but no one is there.

- It’s a **psychological encounter** — illusions caused by ambient Arcanite reacting to demonic corruption.
- Insight or Arcana checks reveal these aren’t ghosts — they’re **residual magical imprints** from long-ago Cohors activity.
- Barcus looks shaken. “The forges remember their masters.”

---

###### **Encounter 3: The Harbinger’s Hunt**

Midway through the peaks, a **demon hunting pack** stalks them — winged fiends drawn by the latent Arcanite energy in Barcus’s soul.

- This battle is harsh and chaotic; the wind howls, snow blinds.
- During the fight, a **fissure opens** beneath them revealing buried metal ruins — ancient warfoundry scraps fused into the mountain. Leads to [[The Steel Cathedral]]
- Inside: glowing symbols, pulsing faintly like a heartbeat.
- The demons recoil from it — confirming _something unnatural_ sleeps beneath the stone.

---

###### **Encounter 4: Descent to the Plains**

At dawn, the party crests the ridge and sees the **Antarian plains** — once-green fields now scarred by war and scattered demonfire.

- In the distance, faint columns of **black smoke** rise from the north.
- The locals think it’s “refugees burning farmland to stop demon spread.”
- Barcus knows better. “That’s no firewood smoke. That’s forge-fire.”
