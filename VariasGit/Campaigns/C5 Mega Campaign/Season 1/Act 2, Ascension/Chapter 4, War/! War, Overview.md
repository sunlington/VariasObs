### Antaria's Response
Due to the actions of [[The Sculptor]] in p[[! Split Descisions, Overview]], The other nations of [[Eroph]] react.
Antaria does not take kindly to the capture and murder of their civilians and responds with forces they secretly were building again; The [[Cohors Mechanica]]. Once more [[Antaria]] is at war, this time with [[The Silver City]] and [[The Sculptor]], with [[Feronia]] caught in the middle.
The players will have to choose which side of the conflict to side on, while dealing with the demon threats that still spread over [[Eroph]]. 
These are the factions they can side with:
- [[Cohors Mechanica]], 
- [[Sculptor]],
- [[Feronia]]
The response of [[Antaria]] was exactly as [[Sculptor]] planned, he wanted to convince people that the weak cannot stand, and uses the bounds of war to do so. This way many people will come to him seeking help and his sanctuary grows stronger.
