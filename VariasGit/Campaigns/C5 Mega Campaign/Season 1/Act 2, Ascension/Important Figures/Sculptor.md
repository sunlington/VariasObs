 ### General Info
While he is known only by his title **The Sculptor** the name he was born with, and wants to forget is **Corvo Teran**.
He will serve as a mid-to-high level villain, and will serve as a sort of "broken hero" archetype. This is his philosophy:
"To Save Humanity, I must change it. If i must become the villain in your tale to birth a better world, so be it."
He is calm, burdened and mournful, yet ever-zealous in his goals. He carries the emotional weight of every sacrifice he makes, and hates the actions he believes he must take.
### Goals
He seeks to forge a **New age of humanity** one free of hierarchy, cruelty and tyranny. He wants to achieve this by creating a society of demon-enhanced humanoids where everyone is equal and none are oppressed by the power of another. He creates these humanoids with dark, ritualistic but scienced based experiments. These rituals are far from save and almost 95% of subjects die in the process. But as he would say: "If I must sacrifice a continent to create a perfect city, so be it." 

### Motivation
He was born weak, frail and sickly in the city of [[Raptus Magna]]. He was a slave of the church, constantly being opressed by his masters. He however was able to escape and fled to [[The Crescent Bay]]. However here he found no better fate, a nation ruled by the tyranny of a few vampire lords, but he endured. When he heard of demonic presence in Alziria he went to investigate and capture some of these demons. He experimented, at first seeking to make himself stronger. But he saw too much potential, he saw a way in which every weak person could be saved from tyranny.  

### Followers
He calls them his "**Ascended**", they are the succesful product of his experiements and are fusions between demon and humanoid. Their skin appears as if made from shattered marble, each having differing features depending on their demonic counterpart. They are strictly improvements on humanoids. They are Faster, Stronger, Smarter and less inclined to yealousy, anger and bloodshed. They are emotionally serene and rational, but not in a robotic sense. While others might see them as monstrous they see themselves as liberated by their creator **The Sculptor**. They often see him as a messiah or leader of sorts, a role he hates, as it violates his perfect non-authoritarian society. But he recognises the **ascended** still have to learn that. 

Their existence raises moral questions, as they are born from the blood of hundreds but express such joy and fulfillment in their new form.

###  Moral Dilemmas for the Players

- Discovering entire populations are being sacrificed to create a few “perfected” beings
- Encountering Ascended who don’t want to be saved, who _chose_ this
- The villain's city or territory is stable, safe, and utopian, _but built on death_
- The villain offers players a deal: **help complete the transformation on a massive scale**, ending the demonic threat forever
- Do the players stop him and preserve human autonomy, or allow a monstrous salvation?
### Quips/Quotes
- "I Feel every bit of pain I cause to my people! But how much crueler a fate would they have met at your hands? I merely adopted the methods I was forced to by an enemy who was willing to do worse."

### Appearance
His own transformation failed, making his form.. Unstable. He wears a mask made of marble, a nearly featureless face.
