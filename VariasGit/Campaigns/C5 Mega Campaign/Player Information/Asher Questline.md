## Foe
[[Nyxarael]] is one of the 7 serpent lords of [[The Black Grail]]. She is the envious, always seeking what others have, or just becoming others. She is not originally a demon, but an ancient [[Volothean]] cast out by ancient warriors. While she still holds tremendous influence on the realm, she seeks a mortal body. She needs not to capture and take control, but for someone to fully sacrifice themselves and their values. They must completely rid themselves of their selves. Thus she captures [[Asher]] and his old party members. She told each the same lie:
> "You are my chosen, I have captures your companions. If you follow my instructions, they might once be free again."

Below is where each party member is (except for [[Asher]]).

### Naib
His grudge, love, and respect for Asher make him dangerously easy to twist. She tells him:  
>“Asher left you. He betrayed your bond. To save him, you must become stronger than him, show him what true power looks like.”



### Cylia
Her duty to Quelaag is twisted into zealotry. She’s made to believe that the Mind's Eye must be purged and only through ascetic self-denial (cutting ties, faith above all) can she save her brother and the world.

### Fredrique
Loyal to Cylia to a fault. He’s shown images of her in pain, her begging for him to finish the mission. His whole reality is built around the illusion that she needs him to become the perfect paladin.

### Kjara
She’s not as emotionally manipulable, so Nyxarael gives her freedom in illusion. She thinks she’s on a quest to save her crew, and the others? Just distractions. She’s convinced that The Mind’s Eye can give her a “second chance” to rewrite what happened. She’s chasing a fantasy.


## Quest


# NON REWORKED VERSION


### 🌑 Refined Villain Concept: Nyxarael, The Black Grail

**Core Themes:**
- Seduction through ambition and the illusion of control
- Love as a weapon—emotional ties turned into chains
- The price of power: what will you sacrifice to “save” someone?
- Tragedy masked as salvation

### 🎯 Nyxarael’s True Goal
Nyxarael is not just manipulating for fun—she's orchestrating a **massive ritual of ascension**, one that requires not just power, but **the willing submission of powerful souls**. These aren't just contracts—they're gifts offered freely under illusions of necessity, salvation, or reunion.
The Mind's Eye is **a splinter of her will**, acting as both a prison and a test. She doesn't need to capture adventurers by force. She needs them to **choose to sacrifice themselves or their values**. Her power grows not just from domination, but **from the lies people tell themselves in her presence.**
### 🔍 The Real Illusion (What She’s Doing to the Old Party)

Nyxarael has made each party member believe:
- The others are imprisoned.
- Only **by proving their worth**—by becoming something “new,” stronger, and abandoning who they were—can they free each other.
- Their old selves are the chains. Their old friendships are illusions. **They must _transcend_ what they were.**

> **"Become who you were meant to be, not who they remember."**

This aligns with her themes. She’s not telling them to destroy their past _randomly_, she’s making them believe that:
- The past is a weakness
- Their bonds were chains
- Their pain is a stepping stone to rebirth

But really, she’s turning them into tools—**soul weapons** forged in grief, guilt, and misdirected love.
### 🧠 The Mind’s Eye’s Role
The Mind’s Eye isn't just watching—it’s reshaping them. It appears as dreams, as voices, as illusions of the other party members to create confusion and mistrust. It isolates them, feeding on the emotional vulnerability of being “the last one trying to save the others.”
The idea that if they meet up, they think the others are just _illusions_ or tests sent by the Mind’s Eye? **Chef’s kiss.** Keep that. That creates some _amazing_ roleplay potential.

---

### 🔮 A Clearer Structure

Let’s give her goals structure that ties into the party:

1. **Naib** – His grudge, love, and respect for Asher make him _dangerously easy to twist._ She tells him:  
    _“Asher left you. He betrayed your bond. To save him, you must become stronger than him—show him what true power looks like.”_
    
2. **Cylia** – Her duty to Quelaag is twisted into zealotry. She’s made to believe that the Mind's Eye must be purged and only through ascetic self-denial (cutting ties, faith above all) can she save her brother and the world.
    
3. **Fredrique** – Loyal to Cylia to a fault. He’s shown images of her in pain, her begging for him to finish the mission. His whole reality is built around the illusion that she needs him to become the perfect paladin.
    
4. **Kjara** – She’s not as emotionally manipulable, so Nyxarael gives her freedom in illusion. She thinks she’s on a quest to save her crew, and the others? Just distractions. She’s convinced that The Mind’s Eye can give her a “second chance” to rewrite what happened. She’s chasing a fantasy.
    

---

### 🐍 And Asher?

Asher is the _exception_. His snake blood, his willpower, and his love for the party make him resistant. But Nyxarael loves that. She sees him as her favorite plaything. Her **chosen**, even. She doesn’t control him—she **courts** him.

She plays the role of patron, of seductress, of false mentor.

> _“Why do you cling to them, Asher? You’re already something greater. Let them fall. Let them become the swords you wield. You’ll save them when they’re remade.”_

---

### 💡 So What’s the New “Quest”?

Instead of “destroy your past,” it’s this:

> **“Prove your evolution. Shed your weakness. Only the ascended may save the fallen.”**

Each party member is going through a personalized “ascension trial” that in reality is _a path of manipulation_ designed to make them emotionally isolated, ruthless, and self-destructive. And Nyxarael's endgame is to _fuse them into a single soul weapon_—a bound collection of love-turned-obedience. An extension of her will.



###  Nyxarael’s Manipulation: The Trial of the Whispering Claw 
##### Overview

While the players seek the three Sacred Shackles to bind Malakar’s cursed crew, Kjara is unconsciously undergoing a _psychic manipulation trial_ orchestrated by **The Mind’s Eye**, an Aspect of Nyxarael. This trial is not separate—it’s **layered into the existing quest**. Her memories, perceptions, and even her goals are _distorted to keep her loyal, distracted, and detached from her past_.

Meanwhile, Asher—who has mild resistance due to his Yuan-Ti nature—**begins to notice the cracks in reality** during the quest. This moment becomes his first true glimpse that **his old party might not be imprisoned**, but rather caught in **personal illusions**, warped by The Mind’s Eye to _choose isolation_.

####  Kjara’s Personal Illusion
- She believes the three shackles are the _only_ way to save her lost pirate crew, who she thinks are _still alive_, imprisoned aboard Malakar’s Phantom Vessel.
- In reality, her crew are **already dead**, and now serve aboard the Whispering Claw—an echo-ship hidden **beneath** Malakar’s vessel, bound to The Mind’s Eye.
- If Kjara successfully helps rebind Malakar’s crew, **Nyxarael intends to make her the new admiral of the Whispering Claw**, using her guilt and desperation to fold her into the larger Gehenna-based war.
#### Layered Events: Trial & Quest Side-by-Side

##### Step 1 – The Lost Cache (First Shackle)
- Deep within the treasure hoard lies an old trinket: Kjara’s **captain’s insignia**, warped and blackened, seemingly placed as a trophy.
- When she touches it, she hears a voice:  
    _“You left us, Captain. But we’re still waiting.”_
- From this point on, Kjara begins seeing **phantoms of her crew** in the corners of her vision—begging, singing, mocking.
- Asher catches one of them **watching him**, not her, when he passes a mirror—unsettling him.
##### Step 2 – The Old Harbor (Second Shackle)
- Within the rocky tunnels, a message scrawled in sailor’s cant warns:  
    _“Don’t bring her here. They know her. She opened the door once already.”_
- Kjara doesn’t remember this, but Asher gets suspicious.
- The **Guardian’s Echo** speaks directly to Kjara, but the party only hears fragments. It says:  
    _“The sea took them. But something else wears their skin. Will you take the helm again?”_
- A flash of imagery shows Kjara’s crew **boarding a ghost ship with her at the wheel**, eyes glowing.
##### Step 3 – The Argent Vigil’s Shackle
- One of the paladins of the Vigil recognizes Kjara.  
    _“You’re the one from the Whispering Claw. The cursed one. I saw you in the vision.”_
- She’s never been there… but in a _Mind’s Eye illusion_, she _has_—she just doesn’t remember.
- Asher may now start hearing the whispers louder:  
    _“Do you see it yet, snake? They’re free. They _choose_ this. Only you cling to the lie.”_
####  **Final Encounter: The Forsaken Ship & The Whispering Claw**
##### Part I – Malakar’s Ghost Ship
- Standard encounter: undead crew, spectral horrors, boss fight vs. Malakar.
- The players begin binding the crew with the three shackles.
##### Part II – The Whispering Claw Emerges (Kjara’s Trial)
As the ritual nears completion, something **goes wrong**:
- The sands below churn violently.
- A **second ship**, similar but inverted, _rises beneath_ Malakar’s—the _Whispering Claw_.
- Kjara is _compelled_ to walk across a shifting gangplank of bone and memory, vanishing from view.
- **Only Asher can follow.**
##### Dual Layered Scene: The Mind’s Eye Showdown

**Inside the Whispering Claw**, the ship is **half-memory, half-illusion**:
- Kjara is met by her undead crew, with her former First Mate **Vel Larron** offering her back the helm.  
    _“You never saved us. But you can now. Steer us into the storm. Be our captain again.”_
- Asher sees the illusion glitching: sailors repeating lines, shadows delayed, whispers echoing like songs.
- If Asher _grabs Kjara_, her eyes flicker—and she sees the crew **chained to the helm**, screaming silently.
**Nyxarael speaks through Vel:**
> _“You were always meant to lead. Mortals need dreams, Kjara. Even if they rot.”_

#####  Decision Point:
- **If Kjara takes the helm**: She becomes the new captain of the Whispering Claw, sailing into Nyxarael’s service as an admiral of illusion and despair.
- **If she rejects the offer**: She breaks the illusion, shattering the tether that binds her crew, freeing their souls.
    - The Whispering Claw burns from the inside out, collapsing as the _Kraken-Lich rises_ from beneath.
##### Part III – Kraken-Lich + Escape

- Just as planned: the final fight, but now **with extra psychic chaos**.
    - The Mind’s Eye’s attention is here now.
- Kjara and Asher are bonded tighter now—either from shared resistance to Nyxarael’s illusion, or shared _failure_ if she took the helm.
####  Aftermath: The Ripple
- Asher now knows **his friends are not imprisoned physically—but mentally**, by illusions.
- Kjara either:
    - Has her soul back, and her guilt finally laid to rest.
    - Or has been taken by the Mind’s Eye—one more “friend” Asher must save _from themselves_.
- The campaign shifts into **breaking illusions and reuniting the shattered party**, with Nyxarael’s presence growing bolder each time Asher wakes someone up.


**Perfect.** Let’s dive into the **Trial of Naib Brorel** — this one is going to be _personal_, _poisonous_, and _achingly tragic_. It’s not just a test of survival, but of **self-identity, memory, and the emotional scar tissue** left between him and Asher.

---

## 🐍🪞 **Trial of the Green Reaper — Naib Brorel**

### **Overview:**

Naib’s trial is built around **control and betrayal**—the two things that defined his relationship with Asher. The Mind’s Eye exploits Naib’s deepest wound: _the idea that he is nothing without control,_ and the fear that **Asher used him** and then **abandoned him**.

Naib believes he’s been trapped in a **warped version of the Nimbar’a Forest**, where time bends and the world constantly resets. He is convinced that the only way to “free the others” (the party) is to **purify the corrupted land**—which, according to the Mind’s Eye’s illusion, means erasing everything he once was, and severing all bonds that weaken him.

---

## 🌲 **Setting: The Rotbloom Expanse (Illusion Realm)**

- The trial takes place in a **mirror version of his childhood forest**, but tainted. The trees are fleshy and covered in snake-scale bark, rivers run green with poison, and the sun never rises—**a nightmarish paradise.**
    
- He has been living here for **what feels like months**, or maybe years. Every time he purges a corrupted grove, it reforms the next day.
    
- The Mind’s Eye has convinced him:  
    _“Only when the last memory is gone, will your friends be saved.”_
    

---

## 🐍 **How Asher Enters:**

- After the events of **Kjara’s trial**, Asher finds a clue—a broken half of a shared token (necklace? dagger? band? something they shared)—with Naib’s voice echoing faintly:
    
    > _“Don’t come for me. Please… if you ever cared… stay away.”_
    
- Guided by the voice and the token, Asher is drawn into the illusion via a **poisoned spring**, where reality folds around him—and he finds himself in the **Rotbloom Expanse.**
    

---

## 🌿 **The Trial Structure (3 Stages):**

### 🧪 **Stage 1 – Memory Groves**

- Asher finds three **Memory Groves**, each corrupted and guarded by monstrous echoes:
    
    1. **The First Hunt:** Their first mission together—now twisted into a shadow-play where Naib _blames Asher for sabotaging him_.
        
    2. **The Confession Campfire:** The night they spoke their truths. Here, Asher is forced to relive it—but Naib’s echo accuses him of manipulation.
        
    3. **The Breaking Point:** A fabricated memory where Asher betrays Naib to the Tide in exchange for his own safety.
        
- Asher must confront each memory—**either by reinforcing the truth**, or embracing his guilt and _refusing the lie_. Either way, this weakens the illusion, causing _Naib's tether to flicker_.
    

---

### 🧪 **Stage 2 – The Duel of Thorns**

- Eventually, Asher reaches the **Heartgrove**, where Naib stands surrounded by glowing vines and carved serpent symbols.
    
- Naib’s eyes glow green—he sees Asher as a Mind’s Eye illusion sent to stop his “cleansing.”
    
- He attacks.
    

#### 💥 The Fight

- This duel isn’t just physical—it’s emotional:
    
    - Naib will _quote things Asher said_ back at him.
        
    - He’ll mimic Asher’s fighting style, showing how he always “copied him to keep up.”
        
    - The arena shifts during the battle, flashing between:
        
        - Their campfire.
            
        - A collapsing Yuan-Ti temple.
            
        - The Tide’s courtroom.
            
- **Mechanics (Optional)**: Every round, both roll Charisma saves. If Asher succeeds, Naib falters in aggression, triggering a _short monologue_ or memory scene mid-fight. This allows Asher to choose dialogue actions that either **push the truth** or **feed into the illusion**.
    

---

### 🧪 **Stage 3 – The Choice**

- When Naib drops to low HP (or the illusion weakens enough), the Mind’s Eye manifests as a **giant white adder-head** curling from the trees above, whispering:
    
    > _“You’ve done well, Brorel. But he always lies. End him, and you will be free of love’s leash. Finally sovereign.”_
    
- **Naib is given the chance to strike a killing blow.**
    

#### Possible Outcomes:

1. **If Asher defends, not fights:**
    
    - Naib breaks the illusion. He sees the **rot around him melt** into nothingness.
        
    - He collapses, exhausted, sobbing.
        
        > _“I thought you left me... because I was weak. Because I needed you.”_  
        > _“But you’re here. You're real?”_
        
2. **If Asher attacks back:**
    
    - Naib wins, stabbing Asher—but instead of killing him, the blood **corrupts the forest**, and the illusion collapses into a void.
        
    - Naib awakens in reality, horrified.
        
        - He is free—but distant. Trust fractured. He’ll need **time** to fully recover.
            
3. **If Asher lies to escape:**
    
    - The Mind’s Eye wins this round.
        
    - Naib becomes a **thrall**—a new assassin under Nyxarael’s service, wielding venomous illusions.
        
    - He will return later as a **mini-boss**, convinced that the real Asher was _never his friend_.
        

---

## 🐍🌙 Themes:

- **Love twisted into doubt.**
    
- **Rivalry turned self-hatred.**
    
- **The cost of trying to “save” someone versus standing by them.**
    

---

## 💀 Optional Final Touch:

If Asher succeeds, Naib gives him something he’s kept this whole time—a **snake fang pendant** Asher once lost.

> _“You always wanted control. But maybe… you gave me more than you think.”_

---

Next up: the **Devotion Twins' Trial**, which could be tackled together or split into two deeply parallel arcs of faith and illusion. Want to proceed with them?



Excellent! Let’s explore the **Devotion Twins' Trial**—a mind-bending, heart-wrenching double-feature crafted by Nyxarael herself to **pervert faith, weaponize love**, and drive a wedge between the siblings' unshakable bond.

---

## ⚔️💔 **Trial of the Devotion Twins — Cylia and Fredrique Palmonde**

### **Overview:**

The Mind’s Eye views their faith and familial bond as **an ideal target for corruption**. She has constructed a dual illusion for both Cylia and Fredrique—**isolated yet intertwined**—each one believing they’re the only twin remaining, and that **the other was slain and their soul fragmented across the land.**

They’re told that to “**resurrect their sibling**,” they must destroy aspects of themselves—**their memories, their emotions, their vows.** Only then, when they are purified and alone, can their sibling return.

Nyxarael’s lie:

> _“Your love was the flaw. Your devotion made you weak. Let go. And ascend.”_

---

## 🌕 **The Setting: The Shattered Chapel**

- A **twinned illusionary domain**, split down the middle by a chasm of moonlight and blood.
    
- Each twin occupies a mirrored half of the same ruined chapel:
    
    - **Cylia's side** is bathed in cold moonlight, peaceful and empty—lonely, like a shrine abandoned by a dying god.
        
    - **Fredrique's side** is crimson and cracked, filled with the sounds of battle and distant sobbing—chaotic, a memory of lost war.
        
- They cannot see each other. But they can **hear echoes**—a distorted voice that sounds like their sibling, always just too late to be heard clearly.
    

---

## ✝️ Trial Structure: Three Acts of Devotion

Each twin must undergo **three acts**, designed to _pervert their devotion_ and **fracture their identity**. The Mind’s Eye watches in silence, occasionally manifesting as a **robed statue of Quelaag with a serpent’s mouth**.

---

### 🔥 **Act I: The Unanswered Prayer**

- The twins are each shown an illusion: a **memory of a time they failed to save someone**.
    
    - Cylia relives a vampire attack where she couldn’t protect a child despite her divine magic.
        
    - Fredrique sees himself too slow to stop a vampire from killing a fellow paladin.
        

#### The Temptation:

A “divine messenger” (really the Mind’s Eye) tells them:

> _“You weren’t strong enough… because you clung to each other. Let go of your heart. Accept the Order’s will. Then you will never fail again.”_

- They’re told to **sacrifice one cherished memory** of their sibling into a sacred flame.
    
- If they resist, the illusion warps, showing their sibling blaming them for the failure.
    

---

### 🩸 **Act II: The Mirror Vow**

- They stand before mirrors showing **twisted versions of themselves**:
    
    - Cylia sees herself as a soulless executioner, purging with cold precision.
        
    - Fredrique sees a version of himself as a warlord, trampling all for divine conquest.
        

#### The Temptation:

They must choose to **either embrace** this ruthless version of themselves (to "save" their sibling) or reject it—and risk losing more time as their sibling "fades."

> _“Your love held you back. Imagine what you could do unshackled. Let them go. Let yourself become the blade.”_

---

### 🗝️ **Act III: The Hollow Reunion**

Each twin is led to a **false reunion** chamber, where they find a **hollow illusion of their sibling**—warm, loving, _wrong_.

- This fake twin thanks them for letting go, for ascending, for doing what they had to.
    
- They offer a final hug… but in truth, the embrace **drains their divine connection**—turning them into hollowed zealots, lost to Nyxarael.
    

#### This is the final test:

If the twin **accepts the illusion**, they lose their soul to the Mind’s Eye. If they **refuse the hug**, they are shown an image of their sibling **screaming in agony**, as if their choice condemned them.

---

## 🧿 **Asher’s Intervention: The Breaking of the Illusion**

After rescuing Naib and learning more about Nyxarael’s schemes, Asher finds traces of **twin echoes** tangled in the very fabric of the Mind’s Eye’s spell. With the right ritual (or relic recovered during Kjara’s arc), he can _enter the Shattered Chapel illusion._

He appears not to the twins directly, but through **reflections**, shadows, or dreams.

> **Asher's role** is to **remind them of their bond**, to say the one thing no illusion can fake: _truth forged in shared pain_.

#### Ideas for impact:

- Cylia remembers a time Asher healed Fredrique when she couldn't.
    
- Fredrique recalls how Asher once admitted to envying their love—honest and unbreakable.
    
- He uses this to **pierce the veil**, and trigger a **face-to-face reunion** of the real twins.
    

---

## 🌩️ Final Confrontation: The Broken Statue

- As the illusion collapses, the statue of Quelaag cracks, revealing the **white coils of Nyxarael’s aspect** beneath it.
    
- She lashes out with **divine psychic power**, trying to reassert the illusion one last time.
    

> _“You could have been pure. But you chose weakness.”_

- A final **shared battle** ensues: the real twins and Asher vs. a projection of the "Perfect Devoted Twin"—a fusion of Cylia and Fredrique made of holy light and venom, designed to represent what they “could have become” if they'd given in.
    

---

## 🎭 Possible Outcomes:

1. **Both Twins Break Free Together:**
    
    - They shatter the illusion with faith and family intact.
        
    - Their bond deepens. They now **remember Asher as the tether**, the one who reminded them love isn’t weakness.
        
2. **Only One Twin Resists:**
    
    - One twin escapes, the other remains behind, lost in the illusion but still alive.
        
    - This sets up a future rescue—and guilt-driven complications.
        
3. **Both Succumb:**
    
    - They join Nyxarael’s cult as radiant zealots, hunting those who still believe in mortal bonds.
        
    - Asher now faces his **sibling-turned-nemeses** in the future.
        

---

## ✨ Optional Emotional Closer:

If saved, the twins kneel in prayer together for the first time since the Mind’s Eye took them.

> **Cylia:** _“You were right, Asher. It wasn’t our god who saved us. It was you.”_  
> **Fredrique:** _“We thought we were strong because we stood alone. But we were never alone.”_
