# ACT I Ashes of Certainty
## 1.1 The Foundry
see [[The Foundry of Tyrrhos]]
**Immediate Events**

- The foundry is partially operational, powered by **Nyxarael-tainted cores**
- War machines are not just scouts — they are **recorders**
- The party discovers that machines are cataloging:
    - Shard locations
    - Battlefield outcomes
    - Survivor lists

**Vaeln Influence**
- Asher receives visions not of the future, but of **events the Cohors chose not to record**
- Kas (through Artemis) reacts violently to _omitted data_
- Subtle hint: _Vaeln does not oppose the machines — he despises their editing_

**Outcome Options**
- Destroy foundry → Cohors scatters, harder to track
- Seize foundry → Argent Vigil becomes _very interested_
- Alter records → Vaeln approves, Nyxarael becomes suspicious

**Shard Count**
- 1 minor shard recovered or denied
## 1.2 The Silver Arrives -> Perhaps have them followed a bit then make them appear
### **Plot Hook**

Days after the foundry conflict, the Argent Vigil arrives—not with an army, but with **authority**. They claim jurisdiction under “Post-Stand Abyssal Law.”
They already know:
- Kas is active
- A Grail-adjacent artifact has resurfaced
- Someone nearby hears _the Whisper After Silence_

They do **not** yet know who holds the Hand.
### **Encounters**
1. **Inquisitorial Interrogation (Social Trial)**
    - PCs questioned separately
    - Contradictions are logged, not punished
2. **Penitent Legion Escort Mission**
    - PCs must accompany condemned Vigil knights to cleanse a corrupted chapel
    - The condemned speak _uncomfortable truths_
3. **Silent Duel**
    - A Vigil knight challenges Artemis—not to kill, but to test Kas’ influence
### **Important NPCs**
- **Inquisitor Lethain Vohr** – Believes truth is more dangerous than demons
- **Archivist Merethel** – Quietly sympathetic, secretly cataloging contradictions
- **High Templar Cassiel (Distant Presence)** – His words are relayed, filtered, softened
### **Specific Party Goal**
- **Survive Vigil scrutiny without losing autonomy**
- Decide whether to:
    - Cooperate openly
    - Withhold knowledge
    - Feed the Vigil curated truths

> Vaeln grows stronger if they choose _partial honesty_

## 1.3 The First Major Shard
### **Plot Hook**

An abandoned battlefield from the Argent Stand era begins “remembering itself.” Survivors report hearing names of the dead spoken aloud—by no one.

The Vigil wants it sealed.  
Demons want it claimed.  
The land itself wants to speak.

### **Encounters**
1. **The Remembered Dead**
    - Spirits that test PCs by asking what they forgot
2. **Shardbound Guardian**
    - An Argent Vigil martyr fused with the shard
    - Cannot be slain until acknowledged
3. **Demonic Retrieval Team**
    - Khaldrith’s forces attempt a precision grab, not a battle
### **Important NPCs**
- **The Last Standard-Bearer** – A spirit who remembers the Stand incorrectly
- **Placiduas (Echo)** – Appears briefly, offering mercy to those who lie to themselves

### **Specific Party Goal**
- **Secure 1 Major Shard**
- Choose whether the battlefield:
    - Becomes a memorial
    - Is erased
    - Is weaponized

- The Vigil should lie _sincerely_
- Let PCs win battles — **then question the victory**
- Shards are not power-ups; they are **burdens of truth**
