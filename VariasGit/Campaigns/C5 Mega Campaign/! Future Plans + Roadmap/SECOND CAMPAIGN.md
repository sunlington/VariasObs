# CORE DESIGN PRINCIPLE

### **Nyxarael never lies outright.**

She:

- reframes
    
- withholds
    
- redirects blame
    
- lets others draw the “wrong” conclusion
    

Group A sees **Nyxarael the Stabilizer**  
Group B uncovers **Nyxarael the Usurper**

Vaeln sits at the center, silently benefiting from _both_.

---

# STRUCTURAL SOLUTION: TWO CAMPAIGNS, ONE LIE

Think of the year as **three parallel layers**:

|Layer|Perspective|Truth Access|
|---|---|---|
|Group A|Strategic, heroic|Partial, curated|
|Group B|Investigative, tragic|Fragmentary but deeper|
|Vaeln|Omniscient|Complete, uninterested|

Group B never _contradicts_ Group A’s experiences — they **recontextualize** them.

---

# WHO IS GROUP B?

Group B should be **structurally positioned** to see what Group A cannot.

### Ideal Group B Identities

Pick 2–3 of these:
- **Argent Vigil Archivists / Inquisitors**
- **Former Cohors Mechanica engineers**
- **Gehenna-exposed survivors**
- **Ascendant failures**
- **Agents of a neutral power** (city-state, scholars, mercantile faith)

They should be:
- Less powerful than Group A initially
- More _embedded_ in institutions
- Paid to investigate _after_ disasters

> Group A _creates_ the aftermath.  
> Group B _lives_ in it.

---

# NYXARAEL’S DECEPTION: THE THREE MASKS

Nyxarael presents **different faces** to each group.

---

## MASK I — _The Containment Strategist_ (Group A)

What Group A is told (and sees):

- Nyxarael is:
    - A _powerful extraplanar intelligence_
    - Opposed to Vaeln’s return
    - Using Khaldrith as a blunt instrument
- Her machines:
    - Willing to sacrifice people for the greater good
    - Avoid mass slaughter
    - Retreat when overwhelmed

She frames her actions as:

> “I am preventing worse outcomes.”

**This is all true — but incomplete.**

---

## MASK II — _The Patron in the Shadows_ (Group B)

Group B uncovers:

- Nyxarael has:
    - True name fragments
    - Cultic symbology of **envy and reflection**
    - Pre-Sundering records erased by the Vigil
- Her “containment”:
    - Funnels shards into _predictable paths_
    - Prevents _destruction_ of shards, not collection

She doesn’t stop the Grail.  
She ensures **no one else finishes it first**.

---

## MASK III — _The Usurper_ (Hidden Truth)

What only Group B _can_ learn:

- Nyxarael cannot rebuild Vaeln **alone**
- Vaeln’s power requires:
    - A lie
    - A witness
    - A proxy
- Khaldrith is not her tool — he is her **sacrifice**

> Khaldrith gathers power.  
> Nyxarael intends to _steal it at the moment of completion_.

That is envy made cosmic.

---

# HOW TO RUN BOTH CAMPAIGNS WITHOUT SPOILING

### **Rule #1: Never show the same scene twice**

Instead:

- Group A sees _decisions_
- Group B sees _consequences_

## EXAMPLE: SHARD OPERATION
### Group A Session
- They intercept Nyxarael scouts
- Save a town
- Nyx praises them
- “Another shard secured from the demons.”

### Group B Session (2–3 weeks later)

- They investigate the same town
- Discover:
    - Nyx scouts marked _every shard location_
    - Civilians spared were those near shard routes
    - A demon cult was allowed to escape

No contradiction.  
Just _clarity_.

---

# ARC B-I — **ASHES AFTER HEROES** (Sessions 1–2)

### Purpose

Establish that **Group A’s victories leave strange, consistent residue**.

---

## Session 1 — _The Town That Was Saved Wrong_

### Plot Hook

Group B is sent (by the Vigil, a city-state, or neutral scholars) to investigate a town “saved” from demonic incursion by unknown agents (Group A, unnamed).

### Key Discoveries

- Civilians survived **selectively**
    
- Demon bodies are missing shards — but _not looted_
    
- War machines were seen retreating _before_ defeat
    

### Encounters

- Minor demon stragglers
    
- Nyx-aligned scout construct (damaged, self-terminates)
    
- Social encounter with survivors who feel _chosen_
    

### Important NPCs

- **Sister Halvek**, Vigil field-archivist (skeptical, observant)
    
- **Mayor Tress**, grateful but unsettled
    

### End Note

A survivor repeats something a machine said:

> “You are not part of the record.”

---

## Session 2 — _The Pattern_

### Plot Hook

Comparing multiple “rescued” sites reveals a pattern.

### Discoveries

- Every saved settlement lies along **shard migration routes**
    
- Nyx’s machines never destroy shards — only _redirect access_
    
- Demons are _allowed_ to flee with information
    

### Encounters

- Cohors remnant mercenaries
    
- A shard-tainted animal that reacts violently to mirrors
    

### Important NPCs

- **Former Cohors Engineer Vellum**
    
- **Silent Vigil Observer** (reports upward)
    

### Truth Unlocked

Nyx is **not preventing collection** — she’s controlling _timing_.

---

# ARC B-II — **THE SISTER’S SHADOW** (Sessions 3–4)

### Purpose

Reveal Nyxarael’s **true nature** without yet revealing her full plan.

---

## Session 3 — _The Name Beneath the Name_

### Plot Hook

An erased Vigil archive resurfaces, marked _pre-Stand_.

### Discoveries

- Nyxarael appears in demonological texts as:
    
    - “The Coveter”
        
    - “The Second Witness”
        
- She predates Khaldrith in some records
    
- Her symbol is **a fractured reflection**
    

### Encounters

- Archive ward constructs
    
- A Vigil Inquisitor attempting to burn the evidence
    

### Important NPCs

- **Archivist Merethel (younger / alternate POV)**
    
- **Inquisitor Vohr (early signs of extremism)**
    

### Truth Unlocked

Nyxarael is a **Demon Lord of Envy** — not an extraplanar ally.

---

## Session 4 — _The Mirror Demon_

### Plot Hook

Group B tracks a Nyx cult cell embedded in a city saved by her machines.

### Discoveries

- Cultists don’t worship Nyx
    
- They prepare _vessels_
    
- They believe she will “inherit what survives”
    

### Encounters

- Envy-corrupted mortals
    
- Ritual involving mirrored shards
    
- First direct Nyx avatar (non-hostile)
    

### Nyx’s Claim (True but Misleading)

> “I cannot allow Vaeln to return as he was.”

She does **not** say she wants him gone.

---

# ARC B-III — **KHALDRITH THE LEASH** (Sessions 5–6)

### Purpose

Flip the assumed power dynamic.

---

## Session 5 — _The Burning Brother_

### Plot Hook

A demon defecting from Khaldrith seeks asylum.

### Discoveries

- Khaldrith is being _bled_ of gathered power
    
- Shards he collects resonate elsewhere
    
- His breaches are growing weaker, not stronger
    

### Encounters

- Khaldrith loyalists
    
- A shard siphon ritual
    

### Important NPCs

- **Zathrek the Cinderbound**, demon defector
    
- **Nyx-aligned siphoner**
    

### Truth Unlocked

Khaldrith is not the endgame — he is **infrastructure**.

---

## Session 6 — _The Leash Revealed_

### Plot Hook

Group B infiltrates a Nyx-controlled shard nexus.

### Discoveries

- Shards are tuned to _transfer authority_
    
- Khaldrith’s essence is the **trigger**
    
- Vaeln’s return creates a _window_
    

### Encounters

- Nyx elite guardians
    
- Environmental hazard: envy-feedback loops
    

### Crucial Revelation

Nyx intends to:

1. Let Khaldrith rebuild Vaeln
    
2. Steal the moment of manifestation
    
3. Replace him as the **Remnant Sovereign**
    

That is envy perfected.

---

# ARC B-IV — **THE USURPATION TRUTH** (Sessions 7–8)

---

## Session 7 — _The Observer Knows_

### Discoveries

- Vaeln is aware of Nyx’s plan
    
- He allows it
    
- Envy preserves memory better than faith
    

### Encounter

- Non-combat metaphysical trial
    
- Vaeln asks questions; answers are irrelevant
    

### Vaeln’s Line

> “She will fail. Or she will succeed.  
> Either way, the lie ends.”

---

## Session 8 — _The Cost of Truth_

### Plot Hook

Group B tries to warn the Vigil.

### Outcome

---

## Session 9 — _The Message_

### Options

Group B can:

1. Send proof to Group A anonymously
    
2. Leak fragments to the world
    
3. Bargain with Nyx
    
4. Appeal to Vaeln directly
    

Each has consequences.

### Encounters

- Nyx emissary
    
- Vigil assassins
    
- Demonic interception
    

---

## Session 10 — _What Remains_

### Finale

Group B does **not** stop Nyx.

They decide:

- Who knows
    
- What survives
    
- What is forgotten
    

### Possible Endings

- They die, but the message lives
    
- They vanish into Vaeln’s record
    
- One becomes a living warning
    

### Final Line

> “You were correct.  
> History will not say so.”

---

# HOW THIS FEEDS GROUP A (WITHOUT SPOILING)

- Group A receives:
    
    - Anonymous warnings
        
    - Conflicting Vigil doctrine
        
    - Nyx behaving _slightly off_
        
- The **players** connect the dots
    
- The **characters** must choose who to believe
