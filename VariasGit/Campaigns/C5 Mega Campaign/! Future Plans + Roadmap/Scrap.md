[[Vaeln, He who Survives Ruin|Vaeln]] corrupted [[Sword of Kas |Kas]] resulting in him shattering [[The Black Grail]]. After [[Asher]] opened the seals of both [[Nyxarael]] and [[The Black Grail#**The Seven Serpents** |Khaldrith]] they were both released onto the material plane. 

The demons of [[Gehenna]] and [[The Black Grail]] want to rebuild the grail in the hopes of bringing [[Vaeln, He who Survives Ruin]] back to a corporeal body 

For this they need the shards of the black grail which are scattered among Mostly Eroph and some on other continents.

[[Nyxarael]] demon lord of envy influenced [[Fausto Emirez]] founder of [[Cohors Mechanica]] to rebuild his war machines with her magics. She promised him more power (the basic patron bs) but Nyx just wants these war machines to act as scouts to find the shards, which they already have found a few minor shards. 

Khaldrith employs his demon forces to search for shards which they all bring to placiduas. he also has a few minor shard and one major.

The plan is for the party to collect 30 minor shards and 8 major shards. Or atleast keep the demons from doing so. Rebuilding the grail results in the return of Vaeln but the players do not know this (Asher probably wants this to happend due to him having the hand of vaeln.)
