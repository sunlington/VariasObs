# Act I - What was Broken
## Concept
## 1.1 The Foundry and the First Splinter
This arc surrounds around [[The Foundry of Tyrrhos]], and is already somewhat in pogress. Eventually at the end of the dungeon after defeating the final enemy they will find the first minor splinter. A relic that will resonate with [[Asher]], [[Artemis]], and [[Aeve]]. 
## 1.2  Within the Vigil
The [[Argent Vigil]] has arrived in Antaria, they have come here due to a couple of things:
1. They heard of [[Vaeln, He who Survives Ruin|The hand of Vaeln]] going missing and seek to find it due to it being an important artifact.
2. They know [[Artemis]] wields the [[Sword of Kas]], but they thought he died after his confrontation with [[Sir Placiduas]] now having learned of his reappearance they seek him out to check he has not been corrupted.
3. [[Barcus Taldoran]] has called for him due to the perceived extraplanar influence of the warforged, that he witnessed while in the old outpost in the mountains.

# Act II - The Black Reliquary
## Concept
The Other factions step onto the stage, each seeking to claim The Grail for themselves, wanting to use Vaeln's power in different ways. Players must find a faction to side with, or go on their question in solitude
### Factions
**Khaldrith and his Kin**
His goal is very simple, bring back vaeln and under his lead be able to devour the material plane as a whole.

**The Sculptor and his Ascendants**
The sculptor believes that vaeln, as the "accidental" father of all demons can usher in a new age for humanity. With that power he seeks to turn everyone into Ascendants, evolving mankind into better beings.

**Nyxarael and the Cohors Mechanica**
Similar to Khaldrith but more nuanced, she wants to use vaeln's power to unite the forces of gehenna into a more powerful force, gaining control and becoming more powerful as a result.

**The Tide and their Assassins**
A similar motivation as Nyx but in the human world, their mafia already spans through much of Eroph but they want to rule the world from the shadows. And form a Shadow Government.

**The Argent Vigil and their Paladins**
They seek to destroy gehenna once and for all, take control of the material plane. While under the guise of keeping everyone safe this will lead to a totalitarian world, and one where thinking is as dangerous as fighting.
