A large networks of sewers connecting underground citystates. The people inhabiting them are no better than the sewage that runs through it's pipes. The population consist of criminals, exiles and down on their luck fools. As within the sludge, no past matters, only deals, death and most importantly of all coin. Mortality rates are high, but each and every job makes quick, and plentiful cash. Perfect for those looking to escape their old lives, or those with no other places to turn to.
## History
Before it became a sewage network the Sludgeways were a network of bunkers and supply tunnel predating even the gods. These tunnels were built so people could avoid the dangerous monsters on the surface during the [[Volothean]] rule. Since the rise of the gods, these have become obsolete and were abandoned, and repurposed as waste shoots, of both material and human kind. Nations started sending their exiles or dangerous criminals into the pipes slowly forming an entirely new civilization.
