## **ACT I — THE HAND THAT GUIDED THE PAST**

### **Anchor I: Castle Astryx Vale (The Past)**

**Narrative Purpose:**  
Introduce Sereth indirectly as a _protector of history_ and reveal that Aldros was manipulated.

### **Arrival Complications:**

- The castle recognizes Aldros’ name with reverence _and fear_
    
- Records refer to a “Star-Counselor” advising the Queen before her death
    

That counselor was **Sereth**.

### **Sereth’s Role (Indirect):**

- Appears in murals, journals, and magical echoes
    
- The Queen’s final decision—creating the temporal loop—was _suggested_ to her
    
- The loop exists because it guarantees a specific geopolitical outcome
    

> “A kingdom that never moves never threatens the stars.”

### **Major Choice:**

- **Break the loop** (restore natural time, destabilize regional power)
    
- **Preserve the loop** (secure the past, but entrench stagnation)
    

Either choice subtly strengthens or weakens Sereth’s influence later.

### **Anchor Gained:**

**The Mnemosyne Spire**

Aldros remembers _arguing_ with someone long ago—but cannot recall who.

## **ACT II — THE PRESENT THAT MUST NOT CHANGE**

### **Anchor II: Tellorian Grotto (The Present)**

**Narrative Purpose:**  
First _direct_ interference by Sereth. The party becomes a known variable.

### **Arrival Signs:**

- The grotto’s crystals resonate violently around the party
    
- Monks warn: “You stand out of phase”
    

### **Sereth Appears (Masked):**

- Introduces themselves as **The Constellarch**
    
- Calm, composed, eerily reasonable
    
- Knows the party’s tactics before they use them
    

> “I am not your enemy.  
> I am your consequence.”

### **Revelation:**

Sereth admits:

- Aldros’ original experiment _worked_
    
- The Nightfall Breach was **necessary**
    
- Aldros surviving was the error
    

They show the party a stabilized timeline:

- Prosperous Arcane Isles
    
- No constellation anomalies
    
- Sereth ruling as High Arbiter of Fate
    

### **Major Choice:**

- Side with the monks (freeze the present)
    
- Side with the prospectors (exploit the now)
    
- Forge a third path, destabilizing Sereth’s projections
    

### **Anchor Gained:**

**The Tellorian Core**

From this point forward:

- Sereth actively counters the party
    
- Fate-aligned enemies begin hunting them

## **ACT III — THE FUTURE THAT KNOWS YOUR NAME**

### **Anchor III: The Unwritten Sanctum (The Future)**

**Narrative Purpose:**  
Expose the full cost of Aldros’ success—and Sereth’s fear.

### **The Future Location:**

A half-existent city built from unrealized possibilities.

Statues depict:

- Aldros as _Savior_ in one plaza
    
- Aldros as _Tyrant_ in another
    
- The party as legends… or disasters
    

### **Sereth Unmasked:**

They reveal the truth:

> “This timeline was not chosen by chance.  
> It was _designed_.”

Sereth comes from a future where:

- Aldros dies during the Breach
    
- The Chronolens remains incomplete
    
- Sereth inherits control over celestial governance
    

The party’s actions are unraveling that certainty.

### **Final Cost:**

The **Parallax Seed** demands sacrifice:

- A memory
    
- A future victory
    
- Or the erasure of a timeline where a party member becomes legendary
    

Sereth _allows_ this—because even here, they think they can still win.

## **ACT IV — THE CHRONOLENS AWAKENS**

Back at the Last Constellation.

Reality trembles.

The Chronolens activates.

Aldros becomes whole—for the first time in a century.

He remembers **Sereth clearly**.

> “You told me the stars demanded order.  
> You never said whose.”

---

## **FINAL ACT — THE CONSTELLARCH’S DESIGN**

### **The Final Confrontation**

Not just a battle—but a choice:

### **Path 1: Kill Sereth**

- Time becomes wild and dangerous
    
- Wishes manifest unpredictably
    
- The future is free
    

### **Path 2: Side with Sereth**

- Aldros must be sealed or erased
    
- The party becomes enforcers of fate
    
- Wishes are granted… safely, narrowly
    

### **Path 3: Rewrite the Design**

- Use the Chronolens to alter Sereth’s origin
    
- Give them a future that doesn’t require control
    
- Requires the party to give up their wishes—or worse

## **EPILOGUE — THE SKY AFTER**

The night sky permanently changes.

One constellation vanishes.

Another is born.

The world remembers the party differently—depending on their choice.
