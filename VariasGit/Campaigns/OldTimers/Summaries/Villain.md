Sereth does not call themselves a villain.

They call themselves **a custodian**.

> “You call it choice.  
> I call it entropy.  
> I have seen what happens when this world is allowed to improvise.”

To Sereth:

- Free will is a variable to be managed
    
- Aldros is a dangerous anomaly
    
- The party are **unknown factors**
    

They are not cruel—but they are **absolutely willing** to erase people to preserve the timeline where they win.

## **APPEARANCE & AESTHETIC**

- Robes formed of drifting star-charts and broken sigils
    
- A face that subtly changes age depending on the observer
    
- Casts no shadow—only a faint constellation pattern
    
- Their eyes reflect _outcomes_, not emotions
    

When they move, constellations briefly rearrange behind them.

---

## **POWERS & METHODS**

Sereth cannot brute-force time.

They manipulate **probability, memory, and coincidence**.

Examples:

- Attacks that “already hit” before they’re rolled
    
- NPCs who _remember_ being warned about the party
    
- Killing blows that “miss” because Sereth already saw the failure
    

They are never encountered at full power until the end.

## **HOW THEY OPPOSE THE PARTY (CAMPAIGN-WIDE)**

### **At the Castle (Past Anchor)**

Sereth appears as a royal advisor who _encourages the loop_.

> “History preserved is history controlled.”

They argue the party is committing cultural annihilation.

---

### **At Tellorian Grotto (Present Anchor)**

Sereth subtly backs the faction that reduces choice.

> “A stable present prevents catastrophic futures.”

They may collapse tunnels _exactly_ where the party planned to retreat.

---

### **At the Unwritten Sanctum (Future Anchor)**

Sereth appears openly—because this is their domain.

They show the party:

- A future where Aldros becomes a tyrant
    
- A future where a player’s wish causes mass suffering
    
- A future where Sereth is worshiped as a savior
    

Some of these futures are lies.

Some are not.
