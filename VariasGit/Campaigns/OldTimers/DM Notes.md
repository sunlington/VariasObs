# **ONE-SHOT: _The Tower of the Last Constellation_**

**Setting:** _The Arcane Isles_ – a nation of floating islands, arcane ley-lines, and airborne settlements. The capital, **Sagett**, is a colossal flying city-ship layered like a vertical metropolis.

## Premise
High above the crystalline mists of the Arcane Isles floats **The Last Constellation**, a once-glorious observatory tower that pierced the heavens with its star-forged spires. Built by the eccentric archmage-explorer Aldros Vellorian, it served as the epicenter of his research into “the living patterns of the night sky”, an art that let him reshape reality through celestial energy.

A century ago, however, the tower fell silent. A catastrophic anomaly, now whispered about as “The Nightfall Breach” erupted during his final experiment. Starfire rained through the sky, the tower’s heart fractured, and Aldros vanished. The isle drifted into isolation, wrapped in starlit storms and wards that flicker like dying constellations.

Now, Aldros has reappeared.

But he is changed.
Displaying signs of temporal displacement, and claiming to remember events that have not yet happened, Aldros hires the party to enter his abandoned tower and retrieve three artifacts vital to stabilizing his unraveling timeline:
1. **The Stellar Prism**, A crystalline focus that once let Aldros “pull the sky closer.” Rumored to still orbit a broken gravitational engine in the upper observatory.
2. **The Resonant Key**, A tuning-fork-like artifact used to unlock and pacify arcane frequencies, currently believed to be trapped within a sealed harmonic chamber that echoes with voices of long-dead apprentices.
3. **A Star Shard**, A fragment of raw starmetal left behind during the Nightfall Breach. 

But The Last Constellation is no empty ruin. Nature has reclaimed its gardens with luminescent flora that bloom to astral tides. Arcane golems still enforce their ancient routines with deteriorating logic. Sentient constellations flicker through the halls, seeking to re-enact the moment of catastrophe. And deep below, the original anomaly still pulses, alive, hungry, and perhaps aware.

As the party climbs through the tower’s forgotten laboratories, shattered star-bridges, and rotating celestial chambers, they must avoid traps and slay magical monsters to retrieve these items, and save Aldros.
## **HOOK**

# # **ACT I — ARRIVAL AT THE FRACTURED ISLE**

The party approaches via a glider-skiff that drifts between spiraling time-currents—eddies of slow and fast motion that glitter like amber shards.

The floating isle is a jagged plateau, half overgrown with crystalline shrubs that chime softly whenever time “stutters.” Footsteps occasionally echo a fraction of a second late.

### **Tutorial Combat: Chrono-Vines (Briarbeasts)**

The path to the tower is blocked by thorny growths that flicker between two states—vines shifting from seedling to maturity in seconds.

**Encounter:** 2–3 _Chrono-Vines_ (Needle Blight stats with adjusted HP).  
A successful Arcana/Nature check lets a character “steal” a phase of the vines, disabling one for a round.

(Aesthetic twist: the vines lash out as if from both present and half a heartbeat in the future.)

---

# # **ACT II — THE ECHOING SPIRE**

The tower is narrow, alabaster-white, and veined with bronze conduits. Sections hang slightly out of alignment, as if caught in overlapping seconds.

---

## **Room 1 — The Corridor of Misaligned Seconds**

_(Rogue Spotlight)_

A long hall of bronze floor tiles, each vibrating faintly. Most cause minor temporal glitches when stepped on:

- delayed footsteps
- brief afterimages
- momentary weightlessness

Two tiles create a dangerous effect: a burst of compressed time that fires a thin **force needle** like a slingshot snapping forward.

Crystals hovering near the ceiling flicker with a rhythmic pulse—the rogue can track the real trap tiles by spotting where the beat skips half a second.

---

## **Room 2 — The Garden of Rewound Seasons**

_(Druid/Ranger Spotlight)_

This chamber is a hanging garden suspended inside a domed room. Time loops in short cycles here:

- Blossoms bloom, wilt, and regrow in seconds.
    
- Birds flutter briefly before dissolving into motes of light and restarting their flight pattern.
    
- Grass shifts from winter frost to spring green under the party’s feet.
    

A massive tangle of roots blocks the way forward, its growth reversing and replaying continuously.

**Puzzle (unchanged mechanics):**  
A set of rotating _chronal mirrors_ overhead bends beams of cycling “seasonal light.”

Only when a specific sequence of changing light touches the roots (spring → autumn → winter) do the tangled vines unravel.

Reward: **The Echo Prism**, a cool, glassy object humming with divergent timelines.

---

## **Room 3 — The Harmonic Ascent**

_(Bard Spotlight)_
4 pedestals spread out on the edges of a circular room, scattered on the floor lie 4 small stattuetes, each depicting a robed figure singing, 2 look quite similar with now real destinction next to their pose, 1 has a longer beard poking through the hood of the robe, and one is broken, having its top half split off.

Each pedestal is marked with a number, 1 through 4. The players must place statues on these pedistals in the right order.
the four distinct statues are as following:
- Past: (hands raised) Bass, Low heavy hum (for bard: lags slighty behind tempo, bass)
- Present: Clear, stable, steady (on tempo, tenor)
- Future (bearded): Anticipatory, bright (slightly rushing, alto)
- Broken statue: Erratic, unpredictable and out of sync (soprano)

they must be placed in the above order on the pedistal, but the statues on any pedestal emits their corresponding tone. But only when placed in the correct order does a pedestral rize from the middel of the room with a button, which when pressed turns the room into a lift upwards and awards the reward below;


Reward: **Aldros’ Harmonic Key**, a tuning-fork-like artifact that vibrates in perfect sync with the tower’s heartbeat.

---

## **Room 4 — The Ascendant Lift of Echoes**

A cylindrical elevator platform made of shimmering force-light rises slowly. As it ascends, the translucent walls project fragmented visions of Aldros’ past and future selves:

- A young Aldros arguing with an elderly Aldros
    
- A version with arcane burns warning of a “second collapse”
    
- A cheerful Aldros scribbling notes about “inevitable paradoxes”
    

This is your exposition moment.

At the top: the wind howls through a broken dome.

---

# # **ACT III — The Chimera of Fractured Time**

The rooftop observatory is shattered. Metal ribs of the dome curl inward like melted silver. Time fractures drift like slow-moving shards of glass.

Two chimera cubs paw at a glowing, humming orb—**The Chronal Shard**.

The **parent chimera** lands with a bone-rattling roar. Its three heads seem slightly out of sync:

- The lion’s mouth moves a moment before the roar is heard
    
- The dragon’s breath kindles before the flame appears
    
- The goat head seems to blink half a second too slow
    

**Encounter:** Standard Chimera (same stat block)  
Level 5 party + 1 veteran = deadly but fair.

Environmental advantages remain:

- Collapsed metal ribs provide cover
    
- Time distortions allow creative movement (short bursts of slow/faster movement)
    
- A player can attempt to distract or calm a cub to grant advantage/delay the chimera's turn
    

The chimera flees at ~20% HP if the cubs are in danger or it is clearly outmatched.

Reward: **The Chronal Shard**.

# # **CONCLUSION (Rewritten Flavor)**

Aldros accepts the artifacts with frantic gratitude. As he assembles them, tiny afterimages ripple across his hands.

He explains the truth:

“These were once parts of the **Chronolens**, a device capable of mapping not the stars—but the _paths time refuses to take._ I intend to finish my research… this time without destroying the tower.”

If you want a sequel hook:

> “The Chronolens must be calibrated at three sites where the weave of time is thin.  
> One is beneath the sea.  
> One is inside a dying kingdom.  
> And one… is inside a place that has not happened yet.”
