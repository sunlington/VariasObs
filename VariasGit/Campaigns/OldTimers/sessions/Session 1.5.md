# **SESSION 1 — THE MISPLACED THREAD**

**Party Level:** 5  
**Tone:** Disorientation, momentum, first hints of an unseen adversary  
**Theme:** “You were not meant to arrive this way.”

---

## **SCENE 1 — THE SKY-SKIFF & THE UNFINISHED LENS**

**Location:** A modest arcane sky-skiff drifting above the Arcane Isles  
**Goal:** Establish stakes, foreshadow Sereth, kick off the anchor quest

### **Setup**

- Aldros assembles the **Chronolens prototype** on the skiff’s deck
- The device hums softly, constellations briefly visible even in daylight
- The sky subtly _resists_ when it activates

### **Key Beats**

- Aldros attempts a calibration
- The Chronolens flickers, glass fracturing with reversed afterimages
- Aldros recoils, clutching his head

**Aldros Dialogue (optional):**

> “Something is… bracing against me.  
> Not breaking the lens—_holding it in place_.”

**Reveal:**

- Aldros realizes the Chronolens needs **three Anchors**
- He unfurls a partial astral map showing:
    - Castle Astryx Vale (Past)
    - Tellorian Grotto (Present)
    - An empty coordinate marked only with a question sigil (Future)

They begin planning a route.

---

## **SCENE 3 — THE BROKEN TELEPORT**

**Intent:** Split the party from Aldros without killing momentum

### **Event**

- Aldros begins **Teleport** mid-combat
- A pirate strike disrupts the casting circle
- The Chronolens flares violently

### **Outcome**

- Aldros vanishes cleanly
- The party experiences:
    - Sudden weightlessness
    - Starfield inversion
    - A sensation of being “misread” by reality

They are _not_ where Aldros intended.

---

## **SCENE 4 — THE WRONG SIDE OF MALACORE**

**Location:** Isle of **Malacore**, wild lowlands far from the castle  
**Mood:** Quiet, uncanny, grounded after cosmic chaos

### **Arrival**

- The party lands in a windswept field of tall silver grass
- Distant mountains to the east
- A road cuts through the field toward a far-off city

They are not alone.

---

## **SCENE 5 — THE STRANGER ON THE ROAD (NEW PC INTRO)**

**Intent:** Naturally introduce the new party member

### **NPC / PC Introduction**

A lone adventurer approaches along the road:

- Dusty cloak
- Travel-worn but alert
- Clearly surprised to see people appear out of thin air

**Prompt for New PC:**

> You just watched several armed individuals _fall out of the sky_.

### **Key Information Shared**

- The nearby city is **Ormacrel**
- Castle Astryx Vale lies on the far side of the isle
- Roads are relatively safe… mostly
If asked:

- Teleportation mishaps aren’t unheard of on Malacore
- “Strange skies” have been reported recently

The party likely decides to travel together.

## **SCENE 6 — ROAD TO ORMACREL**

    - Speed: 50 ft

##### **Temporal Traits**

- **Afterimage Pounce (Recharge 5–6):**  
    When the wolf hits with a bite after moving at least 20 ft, it may immediately shift 10 ft without provoking opportunity attacks, leaving a fading afterimage.
- **Chronal Reflex:**  
    Once per round, the wolf can impose disadvantage on one attack against it as time “skips.”

##### **Tactics**
- Circles the party, testing reactions
- Focuses on isolated targets

    After a PC moves, a scout can move 10 ft as a reaction, as if anticipating the action.


##### **Behavior**

- Focus on observation and retreat
- Use terrain and elevation

##### **Resolution**
- If reduced to half HP total, they disengage and flee
- Leave behind a **Star-Marked Token**

## **RUNNING NOTES FOR YOU**

- Keep Sereth unseen, _felt_, not fought
    
- Emphasize misalignment, not hostility
    
- Let the new PC feel like fate placed them there
    
- Don’t rush the castle—anticipation is part of the tension
